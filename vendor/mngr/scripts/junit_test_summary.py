"""Generate a markdown summary of an offload junit.xml with per-test run counts.

Each unique testcase in junit.xml may appear multiple times (one `<testcase>`
element per attempt) because offload runs tests multiple times -- either as
explicit retries of flaky-marked tests or because of its retry_count settings.
This script aggregates those attempts per test and emits a GitHub-flavored
markdown table listing EVERY test with:

  - its run count (how many times the test executed)
  - its final status across all runs
  - whether the test is marked `@pytest.mark.flaky`

Above the table, failed/errored attempts are surfaced inline under a
`## Failures` heading as collapsed `<details>` blocks. Each block shows the
test id, attempt label (when the test ran more than once), failure kind, and
the captured traceback so a reader on the PR-checks page can see the actual
error without clicking through to the workflow run.

Flaky-mark detection reads per-sandbox manifest files written by the
`_write_flaky_manifest` conftest hook. Offload downloads `.test_output/**`
from each sandbox, so the union of all `flaky_tests_*.txt` files under
`test-results/` is the authoritative set of flaky-marked test IDs for the run.
