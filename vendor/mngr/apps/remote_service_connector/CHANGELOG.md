## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added: Bare-metal "slices" schema support — new migration `008_bare_metal_servers.sql` (table tracking rented OVH dedicated servers and their resumable lifecycle), `009_pool_host_slice_columns.sql` (adds `backend_kind`, `bare_metal_server_id`, `lima_instance_name`, `lima_disk_name` to `pool_hosts` so a pool host can be either a real OVH VPS or a lima-VM slice; existing rows default to `backend_kind = 'ovh_vps'`, leasing unchanged), and `010` (per-slice sizing columns on `bare_metal_servers`: `disk_gb`, `memory_per_slice_gb`, `cpu_overcommit_ratio`).
- Added: New no-auth `GET /health/liveness` route returning `{"status": "ok"}`.
- Added: New R2 bucket routes (`/buckets/*` and `/bucket-keys/*`), gated to paid accounts: create a bucket (with a default scoped key), list / inspect / destroy buckets, and mint / list / revoke additional bucket-scoped keys (read-only or read-write). Each key is an account-owned Cloudflare API token scoped to a single bucket; the S3 Access Key ID is the token id and the Secret Access Key is the SHA-256 of the token value (returned once, never stored). Only key metadata is persisted, in a new `r2_keys` table (migration `004_r2_keys.sql`). Buckets are listed straight from the R2 API with an in-code owner-prefix re-check. Destroying a bucket refuses if it is non-empty and otherwise cascades to revoke its keys.
- Added: New `paid_domains` and `paid_emails` database tables (migration `005_paid_lists.sql`) replacing the `PAID_ACCOUNT_SUFFIXES` env-var allowlist for tracking paid users. A caller is "paid" when their verified email has an active (`is_paid = true`) row matching the full email or its exact domain. The check is cached in-memory (configurable via `MINDS_PAID_LIST_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, default 60s, `0` disables) and fails closed on database errors. New admin-key-authenticated CRUD endpoints (`/paid/domains/*`, `/paid/emails/*`) gated by `MINDS_PAID_ADMIN_KEY` (folded into the `supertokens` secret); these endpoints reject SuperTokens/tunnel tokens, and the key is rejected on all other routes. Removals are soft deletes (`is_paid = false`) so paid history is retained.
- Added: New hourly Modal cron (`cleanup_removing_pool_hosts`) that mops up any pool-host row left in `removing` by a crashed/timed-out release.
- Added: Configurable `scaledown_window` on the connector Modal function, driven by `MINDS_CONNECTOR_SCALEDOWN_WINDOW` (from the tier's `[scaledown_window].connector` in `deploy.toml`). `0` (default) keeps Modal's own default; dev tiers set it high (~10 min) so the no-warm-pool connector stays hot across a dev session.
- Added: Region-aware host leasing — `POST /hosts/lease` accepts an optional `region` field (equality filter, so only hosts in that OVH datacenter are eligible; when unset the lease is region-agnostic). New migration `007_pool_host_region.sql` adds a nullable `region` column to `pool_hosts`; rows baked before this migration carry NULL and so never match a hard region filter (only leased when no region is requested) until rebaked. The filter is independent of the existing JSONB attribute filter, and the lease stays a single query so the fast path is unaffected.

### Changed

- Changed: `release_host` and the hourly cleanup sweep now branch on `backend_kind`: a real VPS is still cancelled in OVH, while a slice has its lima VM (and btrfs data disk) destroyed by SSHing the owning bare-metal box and running `limactl`. A slice whose VM cannot be destroyed keeps its row in `removing` so the slot is only freed once the VM is really gone.
- Changed: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` must now be an account-owned (`cfat_`) token carrying `Workers R2 Storage: Edit` + `Account API Tokens: Edit` (on top of the existing tunnel/DNS/Access/KV permissions), and R2 must be enabled on the Cloudflare account. See the README for the full migration.
- Changed: Renamed `vps_ip` → `vps_address` end-to-end across API models (`LeaseResult`, `LeasedHostInfo`, `LeaseHostResponse`), all Python call sites, and the `pool_hosts.vps_ip` DB column (migration `003_vps_address.sql`). The field can now hold a public IPv4 or a DNS hostname.
- Changed: `DELETE /tunnels/{name}` and `POST /hosts/{id}/release` are now idempotent at the HTTP layer — a second call returns 200 with `{"status": "already_deleted"}` / `{"status": "already_released"}` instead of 404.
- Changed: SuperTokens authentication now skips the SDK's generic claim validation so the explicit `is_verified` check fires for unverified tokens (instead of being shadowed by a generic `Invalid token` rejection), letting `/auth/session/revoke` work for unverified users.
- Changed: The connector's `async def` endpoints have been converted to sync `def`, with SuperTokens recipe imports switched from `asyncio` to `syncio` equivalents (OAuth callback endpoints bridge to async-only methods).
- Changed: Raised the `supertokens-python` floor from `>=0.27.0` to `>=0.31.3` so the repo-wide `uv lock --upgrade` doesn't backtrack the auth library to 0.30.3 (which would also cap `aiosmtplib<4`); leaves `aiosmtplib` at 5.x.
- Changed: `POST /hosts/{id}/release` now actually cleans up the leased pool host instead of just marking it `released`. The release route runs a synchronous, idempotent chain inline: flips the row to a new `removing` status, strips per-lease OVH IAM tags (`minds_env`, `mngr-host-id`) while keeping `mngr-provider=ovh`, cancels the VPS in OVH (`deleteAtExpiration=true`, by service name), then deletes the DB row. An already-gone row is treated as `already_released`. OVH calls are made directly via the official `ovh` SDK (added to the image); the connector now receives an `ovh-<tier>` Modal secret.
- Changed: `cleanup_released_hosts.py` rewritten into a broad, dry-run-by-default operator runbook that tag-scans the OVH account and cleans every `mngr-provider` VPS (protecting those backing an `available`/`leased` row unless `--include-active`). Keys active-row protection and cleaned-host DB match on `vps_address` (the real OVH service name), not `vps_instance_id`.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Connector auth endpoints no longer 500 on `/auth/session/revoke`, `/auth/email/is-verified`, and `/auth/email/send-verification` — these had been calling SuperTokens' `syncio.get_user` / `syncio.get_session_without_request_response` from inside an `async def`, where the syncio wrapper's `loop.run_until_complete` hit "RuntimeError: This event loop is already running" against the live FastAPI/uvicorn loop.
- Fixed: Pool-host teardown no longer leaks running, still-billing VPSes. The bake had been writing the mngr `host_id` into `pool_hosts.vps_instance_id` instead of the OVH service name, so every connector OVH teardown call targeted a nonexistent service and 404'd — and the failure was swallowed into a warning while the release reported success. The release route is now synchronous and returns 5xx (leaving the row `removing`) when any step fails, so the client (or the hourly sweep backstop) retries. Added `PoolHostCleanupError` and mapped it plus `OvhApiError` / `OvhHttpError` in `raise_as_http`. Migration `006_fix_vps_instance_id.sql` backfills existing rows whose `vps_instance_id` still holds a `host-...` id.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Changed: `remote_service_connector.add_service` is now idempotent; updating an access list no longer fails Cloudflare 81053 ("DNS record already exists").
- Changed: Connector schema migration replaces `pool_hosts.version` with `attributes JSONB`; legacy `version` callers are folded into `attributes` automatically.
