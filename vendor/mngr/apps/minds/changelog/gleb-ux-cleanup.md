Replaced the desktop client's runtime Tailwind (Play CDN JIT) with a compiled Tailwind v4 build step. The chrome's styles now come from a single minified, tree-shaken stylesheet (`app.min.css`) built ahead of time from `static/app.css` -- no runtime JIT, fully offline, and smaller. This is the foundation for an upcoming light/dark design-token system.

What changed for developers:

- `static/tokens.css` is gone; its hand-written tokens + component CSS now live in `static/app.css` (the Tailwind v4 source entry), which compiles to the gitignored `static/app.min.css`.

- Build the stylesheet with `just minds-css` (replaces `just minds-tailwind`). It also runs automatically on `pnpm install` (postinstall) and is rebuilt before packaging by `scripts/build.js`.

- `just minds-start` now runs the compiler in `--watch` mode alongside Electron, so class changes rebuild live. Because the sheet is compiled, a new/changed Tailwind class only takes effect after a rebuild.

- The compiled sheet is force-included into the wheel via `[tool.hatch.build] artifacts`; `@tailwindcss/cli` and `tailwindcss` are pinned to exact versions.

Began the light/dark design-token system, starting with text colors:

- New themeable text utilities: `text-primary` / `-secondary` / `-tertiary` (text on the current surface) and `text-inverse-*` (text on an inverted surface). Pure black/white at three alpha steps; regular and inverse mirror each other and swap between light and dark.

- Tokens are built in two layers in `app.css`: a per-mode value layer (`:root`/`.light` for light, `.dark` for dark) and an `@theme inline` token layer. Switching the whole app between modes is a single `.dark` class on `<html>` -- no component changes. A `.light` scope can force a light island under a dark ancestor (and vice versa).

- The dev styleguide (`/_dev/styleguide`) gains a light/dark toggle (persisted in `localStorage`, honored app-wide via a pre-paint script in `Base.jinja`) and a "Text color tokens" section showing both modes side by side.

- Migrated the on-light text call sites off the raw zinc ramp to these tokens (`text-zinc-900/800/700` → `text-primary`, `-600/-500` → `text-secondary`, `-400` → `text-tertiary`) across templates, vanilla JS, and the shared button/input class constants. On-dark / inverse text (e.g. log boxes, the primary button label) is intentionally left until the chrome and button stages.

Added themeable border tokens (next design-system category): `border-subtle` / `border-default` / `border-strong` (Figma's 10% / 16% / 25% alpha), pure black in light and pure white in dark.

- Migrated the border call sites: `border-zinc-200` → `border-default` (standard surfaces), form-control borders (`INPUT_BASE`) → `border-strong` to match Figma's form fields, `border-zinc-300` → `border-strong`, `border-zinc-100` → `border-subtle`. On-dark borders (the bg-black menus / log boxes) and status/accent borders are left for their stages.

- Retired the v4 border-compat shim: the global default border color now resolves to the `border-default` token, so every bare `border` is themeable without naming a color. Standard borders are now slightly more defined and inputs noticeably so, matching Figma.

Added themeable surface + fill tokens (next category): surfaces `bg-surface-primary` (solid base; white in light, pure black in dark), `bg-surface-inverse` (its mirror -- the neutral accent, pairs with `text-inverse-*` for primary buttons), and `bg-surface-overlay` (the inverse color at 20%, for backdrops); fills `bg-fill-subtle` / `-hover` / `-active` (translucent tints; Figma's `selected` dropped as redundant).

- Migrated the background call sites: `bg-white` → `bg-surface-primary` (page, cards, inputs), `bg-zinc-100` / `bg-zinc-50` → `bg-fill-subtle`, `hover:bg-zinc-*` → `hover:bg-fill-hover`, modal/drawer scrims (`bg-black/20-30`) → `bg-surface-overlay`. The primary button is now `bg-surface-inverse text-inverse-primary` with an `opacity-90` hover (it flips: black button/white text in light, white/black in dark). On-dark fixed islands (the bg-black floating menus, bg-zinc-900 log boxes, on-dark white tints) are left for the chrome stage.

- Added `color-scheme: light` / `dark` to the theme roots so native controls (form fields, scrollbars, autofill, caret) render in the right scheme.

With surfaces tokenized, dark mode now renders correctly across page/cards/text/borders/buttons. (Light mode is unchanged.)

Added status / feedback tokens (Figma): `important` / `success` / `warning` / `info` (one solid hue each, mode-independent) + `focus-ring`. Notice / badge backgrounds derive from a single hue via an opacity modifier (e.g. `bg-success/12 border-success/30 text-success`), which adapts to the surface in both modes.

- Migrated the status call sites: Notice and StatusBadge variants, inline status text/boxes, the danger button (`bg-important/10 text-important`), and status pills now use the tokens; the solid success button is `bg-success` with fixed white text. Focus rings (inputs, color swatches) now use `focus-ring`. Link / selection blue is intentionally left as-is (not part of the status set).

Reworked the titlebar to self-theme from the workspace color in pure CSS. The bar derives a black/white contrast from `--titlebar-bg` via relative color (`lch(from …)`) on a `.titlebar-surface` scope and re-bases the foreground tokens on it, so the title and buttons read correctly on any workspace color (dark or light) -- with no JavaScript luminance and no server-side foreground calculation. `chrome.js` now just toggles `.titlebar-surface` alongside `--titlebar-bg`; the `TitlebarButton` and page title are plain tokens (`text-secondary` / `text-primary` / `hover:bg-fill-hover`). Neutral chrome (no workspace) follows the app's own tokens.

- Removed the now-dead foreground machinery this replaced: the SSE workspaces payload no longer carries an `accent_fg` triple, the accent-preview IPC bridge (`content-relay-preload.js` / `main.js`) no longer takes an `accentFg` argument, and `pick_workspace_foreground` (plus its sRGB-luminance helpers) is gone from `workspace_color.py`. `workspace_accent.js` keeps only the `normalizeHex` helper.

Made the always-dark surfaces (the floating workspace menu and the log / terminal / credential boxes) `.dark`-scoped islands styled with tokens (`bg-surface-primary`, `border-subtle`, `text-primary` / `text-secondary`, `hover:bg-fill-hover`, `bg-fill-active` for the selected row) instead of raw `bg-black` / `text-white/NN`. They stay dark regardless of the app theme but now derive their colors from the design tokens.

Added the accent / interactive token (last color family): a single mode-independent `accent` (a blue, `#0069d9`, chosen to clear WCAG AA as link text on both the white and pure-black surfaces) behind links, selected states, focus rings, and progress. Solid for selection / progress (`bg-accent`, `border-accent`); lighter rings and tints derive via an opacity modifier (`ring-accent/40`, `bg-accent/15`).

- Unified the two blues that had coexisted: the form focus ring (previously a separate Apple-blue `focus-ring` token) and the raw Tailwind `blue-600` used for links / selection / progress now both resolve to the one `accent` token. The standalone `focus-ring` token is gone.

- Migrated the call sites: `Link` (and `sharing.js` links), the ghost-Button "link" recipe (`Create` / `Latchkey` "Configure" / "Adjust"), the `Opt` selected state + textarea focus, the color-picker selection / focus rings, the create-flow progress bar + pulse dot, the accent spinner, the form-control focus ring (`INPUT_BASE`), the auth "waiting" notice, and the Landing "Backing up" badge. The styleguide gains an "Accent / interactive token" section (light + dark) and drops `focus` from the status grid.

Tokenized the last hardcoded-neutral component recipes in `app.css` so they theme in dark mode: the `.code-pill` background (`fill-subtle`), the `.opt` onboarding cards (`fill-subtle` background, `border-subtle` / `border-strong` borders + radio), the `.spinner` ring + top (`border-subtle` / `text-primary`), and the color hex-input pill background (`surface-primary`). The spinner now stays visible on dark surfaces too (e.g. the Destroying island), where its near-black top was previously invisible. The intentionally-always-dark elements (color-swatch rims, the close-button-hover red) are unchanged.

Tokenized the dev styleguide page's own chrome (`/_dev/styleguide`) so its light/dark toggle now themes the whole page, not just the demo panels. Migrated the section headers, captions, demo-card frames, and footer file-refs from raw zinc/white onto the design tokens; converted the text/border demo "Dark" panels (and the Icon12 chrome-glyph demo) from hardcoded `#18181b` to `.dark` token islands; and refreshed the link / ghost-link demos to the shipped recipes. Removed the now-obsolete "legacy zinc" text-ramp section (the migration it was waiting on is complete).

Tightened the corner-radius scale to four steps -- `rounded-sm` 2px / `rounded-md` 4px / `rounded-lg` 8px / `rounded-xl` 16px (plus `rounded-full` / `rounded-none`), defined in `app.css` `@theme`. The old 6px and 12px values round down: buttons / badges / inputs land at 4-8px and cards / modals / log boxes at 8px (the previous 12px). `rounded-xl` (16px) is reserved for the largest surfaces. The chrome content frame keeps a structural `rounded-[12px]` -- that 12px still matches Electron's `CONTENT_CORNER_RADIUS` and the OS window's outer rounding, so it stays the one documented exception to the scale. Styleguide radius section updated to the four steps.

Constrained the spacing scale to a fixed subset of Tailwind's native steps. `--spacing` stays the stock `0.25rem` (so `p-1` = 4px, `p-4` = 16px -- standard Tailwind, with all its docs / tooling / IntelliSense intact). Padding / margin / gap are limited to ten steps: `0.5 / 1 / 1.5 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 12 / 16` (= 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 px).

- The handful of off-scale spacings were snapped to the nearest step, e.g. inputs/buttons tighten slightly (`py-2.5` -> `py-2`, `px-3.5` -> `px-3`). Width / height / inset stay free for layout (component sizes untouched), and large fixed dimensions keep their explicit `[NNpx]` values.

- The styleguide gains a "Spacing scale" section listing the allowed steps and their px values.

Added two guard tests that hold the scales: padding / margin / gap must use the constrained spacing steps, and corner radius must use `rounded-sm/-md/-lg/-xl` / `-full` / `-none` (no `rounded-2xl`/`-3xl`/`-xs`, no arbitrary `rounded-[..]` except the documented content-frame `rounded-[12px]`). Both scan the authored source while skipping SVG path data. The radius guard caught the floating workspace menu's `rounded-[10px]`, now snapped to `rounded-lg` (8px).

Added the type ramp (Figma): six semantic roles defined as `@utility` in `app.css`, each bundling font-size + weight + line-height (and uppercase + tracking for the section eyebrow), so a text element's role is a single class. Color stays orthogonal -- compose with `text-primary` / `-secondary` / `-tertiary`.

- `type-heading-lg` 24/bold, `type-heading` 18/semibold, `type-label` 14/semibold, `type-body` 14/regular, `type-helper` 12/regular, `type-section` 12/semibold/all-caps. Sizes reuse Tailwind's native steps (24/18/14/12 = text-2xl/lg/sm/xs).

- Migrated every content-text site to a role (strict four sizes): 20px headings collapse to `type-heading` (18), the Welcome 30px splash to `type-heading-lg` (24), and 10/11/13px captions to `type-helper` (12) / `type-body` (14). `font-medium` is dropped app-wide (the ramp is 400/600) -- block roles bundle their weight and inline emphasis is now `font-semibold`. Components (FormLabel, SectionHeader, StatusBadge, Button + inputs, ...), pages, and JS-built DOM all use the roles; the ghost-Button "link" recipe uses `!type-helper`.

- The styleguide gains a "Type ramp" section demoing the six roles. A guard test keeps content text on the roles: no raw font-size utilities or `font-medium` in the authored source (SVG path data skipped); inline `font-normal` / `font-semibold` / `font-bold` stay allowed.

- Fixed a `Notice` regression from the migration: the role swap dropped the separating space in the component's runtime class concat, fusing `my-2` with the variant background (e.g. `my-2bg-info/12`) so every notice banner lost its vertical margin and background tint. Restored the space.

- Fixed the same dropped-space regression in the Landing page's JS-built badges: the role swap turned `text-sm font-medium ` (trailing space) into `type-label` (no trailing space), so the four `'... type-label' + tone` concatenations for the mind container-state, provider-status, and backup-status badges fused into an invalid `type-labelbg-...` class -- silently dropping both the type role and the tone color. Restored the separating space.

Dropped the unused `--shadow-seam` token. It was only ever demoed in the styleguide (no real surface applied it -- the titlebar drop shadow it once named is gone), so the definition, both styleguide demos, and its drift-guard entry were removed.

Added an elevation scale: two box-shadow steps defined in `app.css` `@theme` (generating `shadow-raised` / `shadow-overlay`), with a styleguide "Elevation" section and a guard.

- `shadow-raised` is the subtle hover lift on interactive cards (the prior `shadow-sm` value, so cards are unchanged). `shadow-overlay` is the soft floating shadow for surfaces above the page -- menus, modals, tooltips -- taken from Figma's `minds-elevation-1` (two 8%-black drop shadows: `0 1px 1px` + `0 3px 12px`).

- Migrated the call sites: interactive cards / CardPage / Creating card -> `shadow-raised`; the floating workspace menu (previously a heavy `0 12px 32px` at 25%), the modal, and the inbox panel -> `shadow-overlay` (softer and now uniform). A guard test allows only `shadow-raised` / `shadow-overlay` / `shadow-none` -- raw Tailwind shadow steps and arbitrary `shadow-[..]` are disallowed.

Reorganized the dev styleguide page (`/_dev/styleguide`) into two labeled groups with clearer separation -- **Design System** (the foundational tokens plus the shared icon set) and **Patterns & Components** (the composed primitives) -- and added a sticky left-hand table of contents for jumping between sections.

- The light/dark toggle is now a fixed top-right control: it stays visible at any scroll position and floats over the page (no backing bar). It's rebuilt on the `Button` secondary primitive instead of bespoke button classes, so the styleguide's own chrome uses the design system it documents.

- Moved the 24px / 12px icon catalogs up into the Design System group (icons are a shared primitive ramp, like the color and type tokens); moved the workspace-accent picker and the color swatches down into Patterns & Components.

- Each section is a scroll anchor carrying a `scroll-mt` offset, so a TOC jump lands the heading below the viewport top rather than flush against it. `dev_styleguide.js` adds an `IntersectionObserver` scrollspy that marks the active section's link via `aria-current="page"` (styled in `app.css`).

- The color-swatch demo now shows the same three swatches per row (selected / default / disabled) at both the `md` and `sm` sizes, with a little more vertical space between the two rows -- so the size comparison is apples-to-apples.

- Fixed the selected color swatch's selection ring: the gap between the swatch and the accent ring is now a real transparent gap (via `outline` + `outline-offset`) instead of a hardcoded white rim, so it shows the background in every mode rather than flashing a stray white border in dark mode. Applies to both the settings (`md`) and create-form (`sm`) pickers.

Aligned the `Button` primitive with the Figma button component (node 342-4059). The default (md) size now uses the Figma padding -- `px-4 py-2` (16px / 8px) instead of `px-3 py-2` -- and the variant recipes were reworked:

- **Secondary** has no fill at rest: it's a `border-default` outline with `text-primary`, and only tints (`bg-fill-hover` on hover, `bg-fill-active` on press) on interaction.

- **Ghost** is now exactly secondary minus the border (transparent at rest, same hover/press fills).

- **Danger** is a solid semantic fill -- `bg-important` with white text -- replacing the previous subtle red tint; it dims slightly on hover/press.

- **Primary** (solid inverse surface) and **success** (solid green) keep their fills and now dim via opacity on hover/press to match. Every variant carries a 1px border (visible only on secondary, transparent elsewhere) so all variants render at the same height. Disabled opacity moved from 30% to 40% to match Figma.

- All button sizes now use `rounded-md`, which is 6px (see the radius-scale change below) -- so buttons match Figma's 6px corner.

Redefined the `rounded-md` radius step from 4px to 6px (scale: 2 / 6 / 8 / 16). md is the default control radius, so buttons, form inputs, badges, and color swatches all round at 6px now, matching Figma.

Gave buttons a focus ring drawn **outside** the button via `outline` + `outline-offset` (keyboard focus only, `focus-visible`), so it no longer overwrites the variant border; the offset gap is transparent in every mode.

Aligned form inputs (TextInput / Select / Textarea) with Figma's text field (node 345-4059): 12px padding (`p-3`), a tertiary-colored placeholder, a subtle `fill-subtle` tint on hover, and a focus ring drawn outside the field (`outline-offset`) that keeps the `border-strong` border instead of recoloring it (replacing the previous border-recolor + inner ring).

Lifted the accent color in dark mode to a brighter blue (`#0069d9` -> `#4d9bff`). On the pure-black dark surface the original accent read too dark: low-opacity tints (`accent/15`, `/40`) nearly vanished and link text was hard to read. The brighter dark-mode value keeps links, focus rings, selection tints, and progress legible (and clears WCAG AA as link text on black). Light mode is unchanged.

Decluttered the dev styleguide previews: dropped the redundant "Light" / "Dark" labels from the dual-mode token previews (the white/black cards are self-evident), removed the decorative card frame (border / background / padding) from the single-mode previews (Type ramp, Spacing, Corner radius) so the samples sit directly on the page, and dropped the borders from the corner-radius demo shapes (each is now just its filled shape).

Gave the primary button a pressed state: it dims to 70% opacity on `:active` (a step below the 80% hover) -- toned down from an earlier 60% once the press scale (below) was added to carry the feedback.

Gave the styleguide's floating light/dark toggle an opaque surface background (`.styleguide-toggle` in app.css) so it stays legible while floating over page content; the hover/active fills are composited over that surface as a background-image gradient rather than replacing it (a translucent fill background-color would let content show through).

Updated the status / feedback semantic hues (mode-independent): `success` `#5c8a3c` -> `#0c8106`, `warning` `#d49a2c` -> `#b45300`, `info` `#527ea3` -> `#166fc7`, `important` (error / failed) `#f50d00` -> `#d90c00`. All the derived notice / badge tints and status text pick up the new hues automatically.

Further decluttered the styleguide previews: dropped the background from the Elevation section (the two shadow cards now sit on the page, where the drop shadows still read), and removed the card frame (border / background / padding) from the single-mode component examples (buttons, form controls, spinner, notices, links, icons, badges, opt, oauth, section header, dialog close, the workspace-accent picker). The frame is kept only where it carries meaning: the dual-mode token cards, the colored self-theming titlebar surfaces, the dark sidebar / chrome-glyph islands, the accent-spine card, and the page-container / modal backdrop illustrations.

Tuned the radius scale and a couple of tokens:

- `rounded-sm` moved from 2px to 4px (scale is now 4 / 6 / 8 / 16).

- `Notice` banners are now borderless tinted boxes: an 8%-opacity hue fill (`bg-<hue>/8`) with the hue as text, no border (down from a 12% fill + bordered box).

Refined the titlebar buttons (`TitlebarButton`): the foreground is now always `text-primary` (full contrast, re-based per-workspace by `.titlebar-surface`) instead of resting at `text-secondary` and brightening on hover, and the `nav` variant is a square icon button sized by padding (`p-1.5` around the icon -> 28x28) rather than a fixed `w-8 h-7`. Its flex wrappers (the titlebar nav group in the chrome and the styleguide demo) use `items-center` so the button stays its square size instead of stretching to the titlebar height. The `control` variant (min / max / close) keeps its OS-matching `w-9 h-[38px]` geometry but also picks up the always-`text-primary` foreground.

The titlebar workspace title now uses the `type-label` role (14px / semibold) instead of `type-helper` (12px / regular), in both the chrome (`#page-title`) and the styleguide demo -- so the active workspace name reads as a proper title.

Titlebar buttons now show an accent keyboard-focus outline (`focus-visible:outline-2 outline-accent`, no offset) instead of falling back to the browser's default focus ring, which auto-contrasted to a stray white ring on the dark / colored titlebar.

Reworked the `Select` dropdown to match Figma (node 345-4060): the native OS arrow is hidden (`appearance-none`) and replaced with a themeable `chevron-down` `Icon24` overlaid on the right (inherits `text-secondary`, `pointer-events-none` so clicks fall through), inset from the right edge with room reserved via `pr-8`. Added a `chevron-down` glyph to the `Icon24` set. The width prop now sizes the wrapper that anchors the chevron; the `<select>` fills it.

Restyled the status badges (`StatusBadge`):

- **Neutral** keeps its muted fill but now uses secondary text.

- **Done / Failed / Info** (success / error / info) use the full status color as a solid background with white text, instead of a low-opacity tint with colored text.

- **Warning** uses a dedicated yellow caution surface (`--c-warning-surface`, `hsl(49 100% 50% / 0.2)`) with the warning foreground -- a solid yellow with white text would be unreadable, and a tint of the brown-orange warning hue reads muddy. The warning `Notice` uses the same yellow surface.

- The styleguide now shows a full second row of `xs` badges (every variant) instead of a single "Tiny" badge tacked onto the end.

All buttons now scale to 98% on `:active` (a subtle press-in), animated via `transition` (which also smooths the hover/press color + opacity changes). The primary button's active dim was eased from 60% to 70% opacity to match -- the scale now carries most of the press feedback.

Tuned the button press feedback: the scale-down now animates over 100ms on the standard ease-in-out curve (`duration-100 ease-in-out`, i.e. `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`), and the press (`:active`) no longer changes color/opacity on any variant -- the press is now scale-only, so the scale carries the whole press feedback.

Listed cards no longer touch: the Manage Accounts page's account cards and the workspace-settings Sharing section's list of shareable chats/interfaces now sit in a `flex flex-col gap-2` container (8px gap), so the spacing is owned by the parent rather than added as margin on the `Card`.

The "Back to projects" back-link now renders at the `type-helper` size (12px) instead of inheriting the larger default body size, so it matches the link-style affordance scale -- applied on the Manage Accounts, Workspace Settings, and Destroying pages.

Lifted the titlebar's red notification dot into a reusable `Badge` component (`templates/Badge.jinja`, from Figma node 330-4472). It has two shapes: the bare 8px `important` dot (the default, shown when no count is passed) and a count pill that shows a number in a solid `important` capsule (`min-w-[16px]` keeps a single digit circular; it grows for wider numbers and caps at "99+"). Added a `type-badge` type role (10px / bold / 12 line-height) for the count text -- the one deliberate sub-12px role, reserved for the compact pill. The styleguide's "Notification badge" section shows both shapes (the 4 / 12 / 99+ pills and the dot) alongside the in-context titlebar example.

Switched the titlebar requests button from the corner dot to the inline count (Figma node 330-4463): the pending-request count now sits in a pill beside the messages icon (icon + badge in a `gap-[3px]` row, the gap collapsing to nothing when there are no requests) instead of a dot overlapping the icon's top-right corner. `chrome.js` already received the count over SSE; it now writes it into the pill (mirroring the 99+ cap) and shows/hides the badge as the count changes.

Fixed the requests badge showing a stray "0" pill when there were no pending requests. The badge was hidden with a `hidden` *class*, but the count pill bakes in `inline-flex`, which beats Tailwind's `.hidden` utility in the cascade -- so the class never hid it. It's now hidden with the native `hidden` *attribute* (whose `[hidden] { display: none !important }` base rule wins), set in the template at rest and toggled by `chrome.js` via `badge.hidden`. The `Badge` docstring documents that callers must hide it with the attribute, not the class.

Fixed the same `inline-flex`-beats-`.hidden` bug on the Landing page's per-row health and backup badges, which were "hidden" by a `.hidden` class and so left an empty, space-taking pill in the row (a phantom gap) when there was nothing to show. Both now drive visibility through inline `display` -- `style="display:none"` at rest and `badge.style.display` in the show/hide paths -- matching how the same file already hides the start/stop buttons and the mind-state badge. (The backup-download link next to them is a plain `<a>` with no baked-in display, so its `.hidden` toggle still works and is unchanged.)

Removed the decorative color/state transitions so interface state changes flip instantly, keeping motion only where it's intrinsic to a component. Hover, focus, and selected-state color/border/background changes no longer fade: the secondary/ghost button fills, form-input hover tint and focus ring, titlebar buttons, interactive `Card` hover, the inbox row + close buttons, the dialog close button, the create-flow account `Select`, and the onboarding `Opt` cards/textarea all switch immediately. The button press is now scoped to `transition-transform`, so the 98% press scale still eases over 100ms while its hover/press color + opacity changes flip instantly. Genuine component motion is untouched: the spinner spin, the creating-screen progress bar and pulse dot, the inbox drawer slide-in, and the disclosure chevron rotation.

Stripped the card chrome off the auth/form page wrapper and renamed it `CardPage` -> `PageNarrowContainer`. It no longer paints a surface: the border, rounding, drop shadow, and redundant background are gone, so it's now a plain centered, max-width column (width + padding only) -- the narrow analog of `PageContainer`. The auth flow (login, signup, signin, forgot/check-email, oauth-close, settings, auth-error) and the workspace-creation form now render their content directly on the page background instead of inside a floating card. Padding (`p-8` default / `p-6` form) and the per-page `max_width` are unchanged.

The styleguide's icon catalogs (24px / 12px) are now left-aligned (`items-start`) instead of centered: both the icon row and each icon-over-label cell align to the start, so each icon sits flush-left above its name rather than centered over a variable-width label.

Folded the dev styleguide's workspace-color (accent hex) picker into the "Accent spine" section and dropped the standalone "Workspace accent" section. The accent spine's left stripe is the only surface in the catalog that renders the per-workspace accent, so the picker now lives right beside its live demo: pick a hex and the stripe updates immediately. The picker is now a single compact row (label + color input + hex readout) with no separate preview swatch, and the TOC loses its "Workspace accent" entry.

Bumped the dark-mode background opacity on the `success` / `error` / `info` notice and badge surfaces so their shape stays visible on the pure-black dark surface. The status hues are deep, so the prior 8%-opacity tint (`bg-<hue>/8`) rendered as solid black in dark mode -- the green / red / blue backing was effectively invisible. The tint now goes through a per-mode surface token (`--c-success-surface` / `--c-important-surface` / `--c-info-surface`), staying at 8% in light mode (unchanged) and lifting to 22% in dark mode. This mirrors the existing `--c-warning-surface` pattern; the warning notice already used a bright caution fill and is unchanged. The `Notice` variants and the styleguide status demos now reference these tokens.

Lifted the status / feedback hues themselves in dark mode (they were previously mode-independent). The deep light-mode hues went muddy and low-contrast on the pure-black surface -- both as foreground text and as the derived notice tints -- so `.dark` now overrides each: `success` `#0c8106` -> `#12be09`, `important` (error) `#d90c00` -> `#fb1f13`, `warning` `#b45300` -> `#ff851a`, `info` `#166fc7` -> `#4396ea`. Light mode is unchanged. Because the notice / badge surface tints derive from the active hue via relative color, they pick up the brighter dark values automatically; status text (`text-success` etc.) is now legible on black too.

Unified the dev styleguide's section headings. Every "Patterns & Components" section (Titlebar buttons, Notification badge, Window controls, Cards, ...) previously used a small uppercase eyebrow (`type-section text-secondary`) for its title, while the "Design System" sections used the larger `type-heading text-primary` heading -- so the two groups read at different levels. The 21 pattern-section titles are now the same `type-heading text-primary` `<h2>` as the Design System sections, so both groups share one heading level. The type-ramp's `type-section` role demo and the modal preview's inner heading are unchanged.

Renamed the `Icon24` stroke-icon component to `Icon16` (and its `ICONS_24` path-data catalog to `ICONS_16`) to match what it actually renders: 16px by default (`md` = `w-4`), never 24px. The "24" only ever named lucide's authoring grid -- the `viewBox` stays `0 0 24 24` -- while every call site draws the icon at 16 / 14 / 20px. All call sites move to the new name (the titlebar nav + requests glyphs, the `Select` dropdown chevron, the Landing workspace-row play/stop/restart/open/settings actions, and the settings button), as does the dev styleguide's icon section (now headed "Icons -- 16px (Icon16)", TOC entry "Icons (16px)", anchor `#icons-16`).

Then replaced the icon set itself with a new 16x16 set from Figma (the "Icon" frame, node 857-5091), dropping every old lucide glyph. The component shell is now fill-based -- a `viewBox="0 0 16 16"` SVG defaulting to `fill="currentColor"` -- because each new glyph is a filled outline (Figma's "Vector (Stroke)" flattened to a single path); Figma's hardcoded black is stripped so every icon takes the parent's text color. `play` is the lone stroked glyph and carries its own `fill="none" stroke="currentColor"` to match the set's line weight; `settings` (drawn on a 15-unit grid) and `chevron-down-small` (a small centered glyph) are nudged into the 16-unit frame with a `<g transform>`.

- The set: `menu`, `home`, `user`, `inbox`, `settings`, `chevron-right` / `-left` / `-down` / `-up` / `-down-small`, `plus`, `close`, `restart`, `arrow-up-right`, `check`, `play`, `pause`.

- Call sites remapped to the new names: the titlebar Back / Forward buttons use `chevron-left` / `chevron-right`, the requests button uses `inbox` (was `messages`), and the Landing workspace-row stop button uses the `pause` glyph (was the square `stop`; its tooltip still reads "Stop mind"). `play`, `restart`, `arrow-up-right`, `settings`, `menu`, `home`, and the `Select` chevron keep their names; the unused `external` glyph is gone. The dev styleguide's icon catalog now lists all 17.

- Folded the remaining hand-rolled inline icons onto the set so every in-app glyph comes from one source: the modal dialog close button (`DialogCloseButton`) and the inbox modal's close button both render `Icon16 close` at 16px; the Latchkey predefined-permission checkmark renders `Icon16 check`; and the floating sidebar's "New workspace" / account rows (`SidebarBottom`) render `Icon16 plus` / `user`. The Google / GitHub brand marks (`auth.OauthIcon`) and the 12x12 window-control glyphs (`Icon12`) stay separate.

- The floating sidebar's per-workspace row icons are built in JavaScript (`sidebar_workspace_row.js`), which can't call the `Icon16` JinjaX component, so they were migrated by hand: `buildIconButton`'s inline SVG shell is now fill-based (`fill="currentColor"`, no stroke) and the open-in-new arrow / settings gear path constants were swapped to the new `arrow-up-right` / `settings` glyphs, so the sidebar rows match the rest of the app.

Tightened and refined the shared form-control shell (`INPUT_BASE`, used by TextInput / Select / Textarea):

- Padding drops from 12px to 8px (`p-3` -> `p-2`).

- The single-line TextInput / Select gain tight leading (`leading-tight`) for a more compact field; the multi-line Textarea keeps `type-body`'s roomier 1.5 leading so its wrapped lines stay legible.

- The hover cue changes from a fill tint (`hover:bg-fill-subtle`) to a darker border edge (`hover:border-stronger`) -- a quieter signal than tinting the whole field. This adds a fourth border token, `border-stronger` (40% black in light / white in dark, vs `border-strong`'s 25%), surfaced in the styleguide's border-token section.

- The Select dropdown chevron moves 4px closer to the field edge (12px -> 8px inset).

The styleguide's Textarea sample is now a natural two-line sentence instead of three meta lines of class names.

Restructured the titlebar into three flex sections sized 1 / 2 / 1 (left controls | title | right controls), so the workspace title always sits in the exact horizontal center of the window regardless of how wide each side's controls are. Previously only the center grew (`flex-1`), so the title was centered within the *leftover* space and drifted off-center whenever the two sides differed in width. Each side now owns its platform's OS window controls: the left section reserves the macOS traffic-light strip with a fixed `shrink-0` spacer div *inside* its flex box -- not a left padding, which (with `box-sizing: border-box`) would clamp the equal-width left section's flex base size up to the padding, making it that much wider than the right and pushing the title ~36px off-center; a spacer instead lives inside the section, which `min-w-0` lets shrink to its 1/4 flex share, so both sides keep equal width and the center stays truly centered. The right section holds the requests button plus the app-drawn min/max/close controls (non-mac). `min-w-0` on each section lets it shrink to its flex share so the ratio -- and the centering -- holds at the 800px minimum window width. The dev styleguide's titlebar demo mirrors the same 1/2/1 layout.
