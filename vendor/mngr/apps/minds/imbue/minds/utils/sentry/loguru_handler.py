"""
inlines sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru and sentry_sdk.integrations.logging, so we can make some changes.
i'm intentionally keeping most of the old logic so this still behaves roughly as expected/documented.

we probably could/should go through and fully streamline this though to do just what we need.

The changes so far (could be out of date):
- adds `strip_extra` to the breadcrumb handler
- adds `add_extra_info_hook` to the event handler, with a watchdog to make sure it doesn't slow things down
