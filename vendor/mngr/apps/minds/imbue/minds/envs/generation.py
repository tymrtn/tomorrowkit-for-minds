"""Per-tier generation id lifecycle.

The "generation id" is a uuid stored at ``secrets/minds/<tier>/generation``
in HCP Vault, used to detect "the tier server got destroyed + redeployed
since I last activated it".

* ``minds env deploy --yes-i-mean-<tier>`` calls :func:`ensure_generation_id`,
  which mints a fresh uuid and writes it to Vault when one doesn't already
  exist. The same uuid then gets pushed to Modal as part of the
  per-tier Modal Secret push so the connector sees it as
  ``MINDS_TIER_GENERATION_ID`` at runtime.
* The connector exposes ``/generation`` returning the embedded uuid.
* ``minds env destroy --yes-i-mean-<tier>`` calls :func:`delete_generation_id`,
  which removes the Vault entry. The next ``deploy`` therefore mints a
  *new* uuid -- subsequent activations across all developers' shells
  see the changed uuid and know their local state is stale.
* ``minds env activate <tier>`` (on the dev's machine) fetches
  ``<connector_url>/generation``, compares against the per-env
  ``last_seen_generation`` marker under the env root, and wipes the
  env's mngr profile + auth state on mismatch so the dev starts clean.

Why a separate Vault entry and not a field in an existing one: the
generation id is the only value here whose lifecycle is owned by the
deploy / destroy flow itself (every other Vault entry is operator-
populated and survives a destroy/deploy cycle). Keeping it isolated
makes the lifecycle invariants ("created by deploy when missing,
deleted by destroy unconditionally") easy to read off the code.
