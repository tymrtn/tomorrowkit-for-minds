"""Create / delete per-dev-env Neon *projects* via the Neon REST API.

Each dynamic dev env gets its own Neon project named ``minds-<env>``
under the dev tier's Neon organization. The project contains two
databases on the default branch:

* ``host_pool``    -- the imbue-cloud pool host registry. The
  ``pool_hosts`` schema is applied automatically as part of project
  creation by replaying ``apps/remote_service_connector/migrations/*.sql``
  via psql.
* ``litellm_cost`` -- the LiteLLM proxy's Prisma-managed backing store.
  Empty on creation; the LiteLLM Prisma migration runs against it later
  inside ``deploy_litellm_proxy``.

This shape matches every other dev-tier resource axis (one Modal env,
one SuperTokens app, one Cloudflare-tunnel tag scope, one OVH IAM tag
scope per dev env). Destroy is atomic: ``DELETE /projects/<id>``
removes everything (branches, roles, both DBs, the project's pooler
endpoint) in one call.

Staging / production keep the tier-shared single-DB model: their
``DATABASE_URL`` vault entries are the authoritative DSN, and
``wipe_neon_db_schema`` (still exported here) clears state by
``DROP SCHEMA public`` instead of destroying the project. That model
fits a long-lived shared tier; the project-per-env model fits the
churn of per-developer environments.

    Used by ``minds env deploy`` as the pre-deploy snapshot: if anything

    NOTE: Unlike a hypothetical "named restore-point" API, this leaves

    the default ``main``) to the state captured by ``source_branch_id``
    (a snapshot branch created earlier via :func:`create_snapshot_branch`).
    Both databases on the target branch (host_pool + litellm_cost) come
    back to that exact state atomically.

    ``preserve_under_name`` is the name Neon assigns to a fresh branch
    holding the PRE-restore state of the target (so the operator can
    inspect the broken state later). Pass something descriptive like
    ``pre-rollback-<deploy_id>``.

    Idempotent: re-running after a restore that already used this
    ``preserve_under_name`` is a no-op. Neon names the pre-restore
    preservation branch ``preserve_under_name``, so a second restore with
    the same name returns 409 ("branch with that name already exists") --
    which we treat as "already restored" rather than surfacing as an error.
    Without this, a recover that failed a *later* step (e.g. the Modal app
    stop) could never be re-run to completion, wedging its recover-target
