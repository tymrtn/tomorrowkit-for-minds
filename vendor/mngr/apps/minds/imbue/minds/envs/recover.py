"""Recover-target file + ``minds env recover`` reversal logic.

Every successful + every failed deploy follows the same protocol:

1. After preflight succeeds and after the Neon snapshot branch is
   created, write a per-env recover-target file atomically (tempfile
   + rename) at the monorepo root.
2. Run the rest of the deploy (push secrets, run migrations, modal
   deploy, health check).
3. On full success: delete the recover-target file.
4. On any failure between steps 1 and 3: leave the file in place +
   print operator-facing guidance to run ``minds env recover``.

``minds env recover`` reads the file and runs every reversal step in
order regardless of which deploy stage was reached. Each reversal step
is individually idempotent, so re-running ``recover`` after a partial
recovery converges. The file is deleted only after every reversal step
has been attempted.

Per-env naming: the file lives at the *monorepo root* under
``.minds-deploy-recover-target-<env-name>.json``. Per-env naming lets
concurrent deploys against *different* envs proceed independently
(used by the dev test suite where each test mints its own random env
name). The activated-env-aware commands (``deploy``, ``destroy``,
``recover``) operate on the file for THEIR env; the broadly-scoped
commands (``activate``, ``deactivate``, ``list``) refuse if ANY
recover-target file exists at the repo root, so an in-flight failed
deploy for any env is surfaced before the operator does something
unrelated.

Concurrent deploys against the SAME env are blocked by a per-env
``flock`` on a sibling ``.minds-deploy-lock-<env-name>.lock`` file,
held for the entire duration of ``deploy_env`` and ``recover_env``.
