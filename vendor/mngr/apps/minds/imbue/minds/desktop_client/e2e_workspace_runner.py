"""Reusable end-to-end driver for "Electron app creates a Docker workspace".

The flow encoded here is the same one the apps/minds Electron e2e test
asserts on: launch the Electron app, drive its create form via Playwright
over CDP, and wait until the workspace's ``system_interface`` dockview UI
renders through the desktop client's subdomain proxy.

Two callers consume this module:

- ``apps/minds/test_desktop_client_e2e.py`` -- the pytest test wraps
  :func:`create_workspace_via_electron` and always cleans up the resulting
  mngr agent in its ``finally``.
- ``scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py`` -- the Modal-snapshot script
  calls the same function but deliberately *does not* destroy the agent,
  because the whole point of the snapshot is to capture a sandbox in
  which the workspace's Docker container is alive and ready to use.

Everything in this module is non-pytest -- callers pass plain arguments
and own the environment / cleanup story themselves.

    project config by walking up from there instead of the mngr repo
    root. The pytest wrapper points this at an isolated, opted-in config
    tree so the real repo ``.mngr/`` (which carries ``is_allowed_in_pytest
    = false`` plus a developer's untracked ``settings.local.toml``) is
    never loaded under the pytest config guard. ``None`` keeps the mngr
    repo root, which is what the snapshot script wants.

    SIGTERM with a ``_ELECTRON_SIGTERM_GRACE_SECONDS`` grace, then
    SIGKILL -- delivered to the whole process group (Electron is launched
    as a session leader via ``start_new_session=True``), not just the main
    PID. The Electron main process owns the backend subprocess and the
    renderer/GPU children; signalling the group ensures they all die
    instead of being orphaned. That matters for the retry path: a SIGKILL
    that left renderer/GPU children alive would keep them holding the
    profile's single-instance lock, so the next relaunch would bind its
    debug port, fail ``requestSingleInstanceLock()``, and quit immediately
    (the CDP port then refusing every connection). The grace window is
    intentionally generous (30s) because the minds backend that Electron
    spawns needs a few seconds to drain mngr_forward streams cleanly --
    shorter grace periods routinely escalate to SIGKILL and leave the
    workspace in a half-shutdown state.

    Each launch also gets its own throwaway ``--user-data-dir`` so that,
    even if a prior attempt's teardown was imperfect, this instance never
    collides with a stale single-instance lock from the default profile.

    Note: tearing down Electron does NOT destroy the workspace's mngr
    agent / Docker container. Those persist as separate host-level
    processes; cleanup of them is the caller's responsibility.
