    The two cases take deliberately different code paths:

    No ``branch`` given: a plain ``git clone <url> <dir>``. This resolves
    the remote's default branch natively (in one connection), creates a
    matching *named* local branch, and checks it out -- exactly the state a
    user gets from ``git clone``. The named branch is load-bearing: the
    downstream ``mngr create`` mirror push only pushes ``refs/heads/*`` +
    ``refs/tags/*`` (a detached HEAD leaves ``refs/heads/*`` empty and the
    push fails with "No refs in common and none specified; doing nothing"),
    and the resolved name becomes the agent's source-base branch. Letting
    git resolve the default branch avoids parsing ``ls-remote`` output or
    making a second round trip whose name could disagree with the fetch.

    Explicit ``branch`` (a branch name, tag name, or commit SHA): ``git
    init`` + ``git remote add origin`` + ``git fetch origin <ref>`` + ``git
    checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD``, then the caller renames the detached
    HEAD to a real local branch via :func:`checkout_branch`. We avoid ``git
    clone --branch <ref>`` here because ``--branch`` rejects commit SHAs
    (``fatal: Remote branch <sha> not found in upstream origin``); ``git
    fetch`` accepts a branch, tag, or SHA uniformly. The fetch downloads
    only the requested ref's full ancestry.

    Both paths materialise a checked-out working tree, which is
    load-bearing: callers that overlay a worktree via
    :func:`rsync_worktree_over_clone` need a *checked-out* clone, else the
    rsync'd files land untracked and the subsequent ``checkout_branch``
    aborts with "untracked working tree files would be overwritten by
    checkout".

    We deliberately do NOT shallow-clone (no ``--depth``): this clone is
    the source ``mngr create`` mirror-pushes into the agent container's
    bare repo, and git rejects pushes from a shallow source with "shallow
    update not allowed" (the pushed tip's parent is missing from the pack).

    LIMA mode: --template main --template lima (runs in Lima VM)
    VULTR mode: --template main --template vultr (runs in Docker on a Vultr VPS)
    AWS mode: --new-host on the aws-<region> provider, --template main
        --template aws (runs in a runsc Docker container on an EC2 instance;
        the region-specific provider block is written by minds at startup)
    IMBUE_CLOUD mode: --new-host on the imbue_cloud_<slug> provider (the
        plugin's create_host adopts the pool's pre-baked agent under
        the lease's baked name); ``imbue_cloud_*`` arguments encode the
        lease attributes (--build-arg).

    Every mode creates a separate host, so the agent address uses
    ``system-services@<host_name>`` -- the agent name is constant across
    every minds workspace; the host name (the user's input from the
    create-project form) is the workspace identifier. Only IMBUE_CLOUD
    passes ``--reuse`` (to satisfy the pre-baked services-agent on the
    pool host); the other modes rely on ``--new-host`` for fresh-host
    intent and pass neither ``--reuse`` nor ``--update`` because
    mngr's ``--reuse`` matches on agent name without host scope.

    Secrets (``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``, ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``) are forwarded by
    the FCT template's own ``pass_(host_)env`` declarations, not by inline
    flags here -- ``run_mngr_create`` populates them in the subprocess env
    when needed and the template-declared forwards pick them up. Keeping the
    forwarding declaration in FCT means the same template works for ``mngr
    create`` invocations from outside minds too.

    ``latchkey_env`` is the latchkey wiring (gateway URL, password, JWT,
    disable-counting flag) computed by
    :func:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.agent_setup.prepare_agent_latchkey`. The
    caller decides whether the agent is tunneled (constant agent-side
    loopback URL) or running on the bare host (live gateway port);
    this function just lifts the entries into ``--host-env`` flags so
    every agent that ever runs on the new host inherits the same
    gateway wiring. Pass ``None`` or an empty dict to opt the host out
    of latchkey wiring.

          ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` so the agent talks to LiteLLM. Requires

          talks to the official Anthropic API.
        - ``SUBSCRIPTION`` -- inject neither; the user signs in to Claude
          interactively in the workspace.

        For ``LaunchMode.IMBUE_CLOUD``, the agent runs on a leased pool host
        via the ``imbue_cloud_<account-slug>`` provider; the plugin's

        and the rest of mngr's create pipeline adopts the pool host's
        pre-baked agent under the requested name. The plugin owns the
        SuperTokens session, so minds only needs to know which account to
        ask for.

        When ``on_created`` is provided, it is called with the canonical
        ``AgentId`` once ``mngr create`` returns (immediately before the

        ``info.agent_id`` once it's populated) or ``get_log_queue()`` to
        stream creation logs. The minds-internal ``CreationId`` and the
