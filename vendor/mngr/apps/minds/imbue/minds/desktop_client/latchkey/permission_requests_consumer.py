"""Background streaming consumer for the ``permission-requests`` extension.

Spawned at desktop-client startup, owns a daemon thread that holds a
long-lived ``GET /permission-requests?follow=true`` connection open
against the shared latchkey gateway. Each pending request streamed
over that connection is translated into a
:class:`LatchkeyPredefinedPermissionRequestEvent` and appended to the in-memory
:class:`RequestInbox` exactly the way agent-written JSONL events used
to be (before latchkey 2.9.0 grew the extension layer).

The consumer must be resilient: a network blip or a gateway restart
will tear the stream down, but the on-disk request files survive, so
the consumer just reconnects with bounded backoff and the next stream
re-emits everything that is still pending. There is no need to
deduplicate -- the inbox keys requests by ``event_id``, which we
populate from the extension-generated ``request_id``, so a redelivered
request idempotently overwrites the previous entry.
