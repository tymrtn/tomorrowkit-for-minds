"""Predefined-permission grant/deny flow (``RequestType.LATCHKEY_PERMISSION``).

This module is one of the two sibling handlers under
:mod:`imbue.minds.desktop_client.latchkey.handlers`. It owns the
flow for *predefined* (catalog-backed) permission requests: rendering
the per-permission dialog, probing credential status, running
``latchkey auth browser`` when needed, rewriting the per-host
``latchkey_permissions.json`` via the gateway extension, appending the
response event, and notifying the waiting agent via ``mngr message``.

The :mod:`.file_sharing` sibling handles file-sharing permission
requests (single path, yes/no decision). Both siblings share the
:class:`~.messaging.MngrMessageSender` helper.

Services that latchkey reports as not supporting browser sign-in fall
back to a manual flow: the grant is refused (the request stays pending),
the user is shown the suggested ``latchkey auth set`` invocation, and a
fresh Approve click re-runs ``latchkey services info`` to check whether
credentials have since become valid.

The route layer in ``app.py`` is intentionally thin: it authenticates,
looks up the request event by id, and dispatches by request type. All
the latchkey-specific work lives here.
