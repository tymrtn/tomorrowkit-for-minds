# Unabridged Changelog - mngr_kanpan

Full, unedited changelog entries consolidated nightly from individual files in `libs/mngr_kanpan/changelog/`.

For a concise summary, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-06-15

`mngr kanpan --help` synopsis: replace placeholder `[OPTIONS]` with an enumerated list of the filter flags users typically reach for -- `[--include CEL] [--exclude CEL] [--running] [--stopped] [--archived] [--active] [--local] [--remote] [--project PROJECT]`. The full agent-filter set is still available; rarely-used flags (`--label`, `--host-label`) are omitted from the synopsis but remain on the command.

## 2026-06-14

Fixed the kanpan footer flickering when a background refresh and a user action (e.g. deleting a marked agent) ran at the same time. The footer is now driven by a single writer that picks what to show by priority (transient notification > active action > refresh spinner > marked-agent summary > steady text), so overlapping spinner loops can no longer overwrite each other on alternating ticks.

Batch operations in the kanpan TUI (delete, push, and markable custom commands) now surface failures instead of silently doing nothing. When `x` execution fails, the per-agent error detail (including a clear "timed out after Ns" message for timeouts) is listed at the bottom of the board, in the same place fetch errors appear, and persists until the next execution. The marks for failed agents are kept so you can retry.

## 2026-06-10

`mngr kanpan --format json` now prints a single board snapshot instead of launching the TUI, for programmatic use. The JSON has the ordered columns, agents grouped into sections (with human labels), and any fetch errors; each agent carries both the pre-rendered cells (text/url/color) and the structured field values (PR number, CI status, commits-ahead count, etc.).

`--format jsonl` is also supported: it emits one agent record per line in board order, followed by any error lines.

Previously `--format json` was accepted but silently ignored.

The GitHub data source now pages through PR search results instead of fetching only the first 100. Boards tracking more than 100 agents previously hit GitHub's hard per-page cap and silently rendered "Create PR" for the overflow agents; kanpan now follows the search cursor and fetches every page (up to GitHub's ~1000-result ceiling, beyond which it surfaces an explicit error).

Each page request is also retried with exponential backoff when GitHub returns a transient failure (HTTP 403 secondary rate limit, 5xx, or an unparseable body). A failure on a later page keeps the pages already fetched and retries only the failing page, so earlier results are never re-fetched.

Raised the stale coverage floor from 83% to 85% to match the coverage CI already measures (~86%).

## 2026-06-04

Adopted the new repo-wide `per-file host uploads inside loops` ratchet check (flags write_file/write_text_file/put_file calls inside loops, which should use a single rsync via host.copy_directory instead). No production code change in this project.

## 2026-06-01

Fixed a bug where muted agents could appear mixed in with the other rows
(typically alongside "PRs not loaded") whenever provider discovery transiently
failed during a refresh -- e.g. a flaky network connection to a remote
provider. Previously the board loaded the muted set with a separate
all-or-nothing discovery pass, so if any one provider failed to load, the
entire muted set came back empty and every agent was reclassified by its PR
state.

The muted flag is now surfaced as a regular agent field via kanpan's
`agent_field_generators` (online) and `offline_agent_field_generators`
(offline) hooks, so it rides on the same agent list the board already fetches
through `list_agents` -- which tolerates a failing provider. A provider failing
during a refresh no longer drops the muted classification of agents on the
providers that did load, and the muted bit is preserved for offline/unreachable
agents too.

# Dropped redundant per-project ty/ruff ratchet tests

Removed this project's `test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors` from its
`test_ratchets.py`. ty resolves the uv workspace root and ruff (run from the repo
root) both scan across projects, so the per-project copies just re-ran the same
checks. The single repo-wide equivalents now live in `test_meta_ratchets.py`
(`test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors`).

No user-facing behavior change.

# ty 0.0.39 type fixes

- Converted bracketed `# type: ignore[...]` suppressions to `# ty: ignore[...]` (test file), as required by `ty` 0.0.39.
- `_submit_batch_item` now dispatches on the command type with a `match` statement (`case MarkableBuiltinCommand()/ActionBuiltinCommand()/CustomCommand()`, with a `case _: assert_never(item.cmd)` catch-all) instead of an `isinstance` chain. This narrows `item.cmd` to `CustomCommand` before reading `.command` (which ty could not prove via the previous structure) and makes exhaustiveness explicit. Behavior is unchanged.
- Documented the urwid `Widget` -> `Text` downcast on a row's name cell with a `# ty: ignore[invalid-assignment]` (the first column is always a `Text` by construction, but urwid types `.contents` only as `Widget`).

- Tightened this project's `test_ratchets.py` violation counts to their exact current values (`--inline-snapshot=trim`).

No user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-05-26

- Pruned non-notable entries (test-only changes, internal refactors, and doc-only tweaks with no user-facing effect) from this project's CHANGELOG.md, per the new notable-only changelog policy.

Adopted the `PREVENT_BARE_TMUX_TARGETS` ratchet rule (added in `imbue_common`) via
`rc.check_bare_tmux_targets(_DIR, snapshot(0))` in this project's `test_ratchets.py`.
This ratchet prevents new occurrences of `tmux <subcmd> -t '<bare-name>'` -- targets
without a leading `=` exact-match prefix, which can silently route commands to a
sibling session whose name shares a prefix with the intended one. No production code
changes in this project; the adopting test starts at a baseline of zero violations.

## 2026-05-26

Collapse the GitHub data source's four separate `gh` calls (`gh pr list --state open`, `gh pr list --state all`, `gh pr view --json mergeable`, `gh api graphql` for unresolved threads) into a single `gh api graphql` request per board refresh. The new query uses GitHub search's OR semantics over `repo:` and `head:` qualifiers to filter directly to the (repo, branch) pairs the agents need, and embeds `mergeable`, `statusCheckRollup { state }`, `reviewThreads`, and `comments` inline on every returned PullRequest. This eliminates the gh HTTP cache race that the lock-based fix was working around (no `gh pr list`, no SearchType introspection, no cache file to corrupt), provides an atomic point-in-time snapshot of the entire board, and cuts the refresh from 2M+2K HTTP calls (where M = unique repos, K = open PRs) to exactly one. Removes ~250 lines of fetch/parse/orchestration code along with the `_GH_PR_LIST_LOCK`, the `ThreadPoolExecutor`, and the conflicts/unresolved second-pass fetcher.

## 2026-05-21

Fix the intro in `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` so it references the correct entries directory. The path was `changelog/<project>/` (which never existed); the actual layout is `<project_dir>/changelog/`.

## 2026-05-20

Project now participates in the per-project changelog layout: a `changelog/` subdirectory holds per-PR entry files, and `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` at the project root hold the consolidated history. See the full rationale in `dev/changelog/mngr-changelog-per-project.md`.

## mngr_kanpan: staleness taint semantics

Field values now track when they were computed and render dimmed when older than a configurable threshold, surfacing potentially-out-of-date data at a glance.

- Added a required `created: datetime` field to every `FieldValue`. Values derived from cached inputs inherit the oldest `created` of the inputs they actually used (taint propagation); world-derived values use the current time.
- Added `staleness_threshold_seconds` to `KanpanPluginConfig`. Defaults to 90% of `refresh_interval_seconds` so values that weren't refreshed last cycle render as stale.
- Stale cells render in dark grey via new `stale` / `stale_focus` urwid palette entries. Muted-row dimming wins over per-cell stale dimming.
- `ShellCommandConfig` now declares its cached `inputs` explicitly so shell-derived staleness can propagate correctly. Shells with no declared inputs are treated as world-fresh.
