## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.17] - 2026-06-18

## [v0.2.16] - 2026-06-16

## [v0.2.15] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr kanpan --help` synopsis now enumerates the commonly-used filter flags (`--include` / `--exclude` / `--running` / `--stopped` / `--archived` / `--active` / `--local` / `--remote` / `--project`) instead of showing `[OPTIONS]`.

## [v0.2.14] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Fixed: The kanpan footer no longer flickers when a background refresh and a user action (e.g. deleting a marked agent) run at the same time. A single writer now picks what to show by priority, so overlapping spinner loops can't overwrite each other on alternating ticks.
- Fixed: Batch operations in the kanpan TUI (delete, push, markable custom commands) now surface per-agent failure details (including a clear "timed out after Ns" message) at the bottom of the board instead of silently doing nothing. Marks for failed agents are kept so you can retry.

## [v0.2.13] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added: `mngr kanpan --format json` now prints a single board snapshot instead of launching the TUI — the JSON has ordered columns, agents grouped into sections with human labels, and any fetch errors; each agent carries both the pre-rendered cells and the structured field values (PR number, CI status, commits-ahead count, etc.). `--format jsonl` emits one agent record per line in board order, followed by error lines. Previously `--format json` was accepted but silently ignored.

### Fixed

- Fixed: GitHub data source now pages through PR search results instead of fetching only the first 100. Boards tracking more than 100 agents previously hit GitHub's hard per-page cap and silently rendered "Create PR" for the overflow agents; kanpan now follows the search cursor (up to GitHub's ~1000-result ceiling, beyond which it surfaces an explicit error).
- Fixed: Each GitHub page request is now retried with exponential backoff when GitHub returns a transient failure (HTTP 403 secondary rate limit, 5xx, or an unparseable body). A failure on a later page keeps earlier pages and retries only the failing page.

## [v0.2.12] - 2026-06-08

## [v0.2.11] - 2026-06-05

## [v0.2.10] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Fixed: Muted agents no longer appear mixed in with other rows (typically alongside "PRs not loaded") when provider discovery transiently fails during a refresh. The muted flag now rides on the same agent list the board already fetches via the `agent_field_generators` (online) and `offline_agent_field_generators` (offline) hooks, so a single provider failing during a refresh no longer drops the muted classification of agents on providers that did load, and the muted bit is preserved for offline/unreachable agents too.

## [v0.2.9] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Changed: GitHub data source now refreshes via a single `gh api graphql` request per board cycle (with mergeability, status checks, review threads, and comments embedded inline), replacing the four separate `gh` calls and eliminating the gh HTTP cache race.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added: `mngr_kanpan` field-value staleness — each `FieldValue` carries a `created` timestamp, taint propagates through cached inputs, and stale cells render dimmed; new `staleness_threshold_seconds` config.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `mngr kanpan` no longer logs per-agent CEL warnings for `--include` / `--exclude` filters that reference keys on tolerant schemaless fields.
