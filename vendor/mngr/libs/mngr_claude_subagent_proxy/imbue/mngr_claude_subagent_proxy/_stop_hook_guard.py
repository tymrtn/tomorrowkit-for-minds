"""Shared logic for wrapping user-installed Stop / SubagentStop hooks
with the ``MNGR_CLAUDE_SUBAGENT_PROXY_CHILD`` env-conditional guard.

Lives in its own module (not ``plugin.py``) so the SessionStart hook
in ``hooks/reap.py`` can apply the same wrap to per-agent plugin caches
that Claude Code populates AFTER provisioning. plugin.py-time wraps
miss those entirely because the cache is fetched fresh from GitHub
when claude starts, not copied from the user marketplace.

Pure dict / file manipulation here -- no host abstraction, no pluggy
imports -- so reap.py can import this without inducing a circular
dependency back to plugin.py.
