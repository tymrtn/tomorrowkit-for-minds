"""PostToolUse:Agent hook. Tears down the mngr subagent and cleans up
per-tool_use_id state files after the Task tool returns.

The subagent's actual end-turn text reaches the parent via Haiku's own
final reply (the wait-script prints the text to Haiku's stdout and
Haiku is instructed to echo it verbatim) -- not via this hook, because
Claude Code's PostToolUse ``updatedToolOutput`` field is MCP-only and
does not apply to built-in tools like Task.

Exits 0 on any failure so Claude Code keeps running.
