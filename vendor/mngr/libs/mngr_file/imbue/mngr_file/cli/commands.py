Use 'get' to read a file, 'put' to write a file, and 'list' to list
files in a directory. TARGET can be an agent or host name/ID.

Paths can be absolute or relative. For agent targets, relative paths
are resolved against the agent's work directory by default. Use
--relative-to to change the base: 'state' for the agent state
directory, or 'host' for the host directory. For host targets,
relative paths always resolve against the host directory.""",
