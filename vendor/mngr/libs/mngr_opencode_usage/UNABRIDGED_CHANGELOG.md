## 2026-06-16

New package `imbue-mngr-opencode-usage`: cost/usage tracking for OpenCode agents in `mngr usage`. It installs a second in-process OpenCode plugin (alongside the lifecycle one) that appends one `cost_snapshot` event per assistant message -- OpenCode's own per-message cost (reported, not estimated) plus tokens and the provider-qualified model -- to `events/opencode/usage/events.jsonl`. A reader hookimpl claims the `opencode` source and aggregates it with the session-incremental strategy (sum each session's messages). After provisioning an OpenCode agent, its spend now shows up in `mngr usage` like Claude's.
