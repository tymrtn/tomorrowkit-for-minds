## [Unreleased]

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added: VM-level stop/start lifecycle for Azure hosts. `mngr stop` now **deallocates** the VM (halting compute billing, unlike an OS-level shutdown), preserving the OS disk so a paused agent costs only disk storage; `mngr start` re-allocates it. A deallocated VM stays discoverable via VM tags, so `mngr list` and `mngr start <agent>` keep working. The public IP is static, so SSH host keys survive the stop with no known_hosts rebind.
- Added: Idle self-deallocate via a system-assigned managed identity — the in-VM idle watcher calls the ARM `deallocate` API (via its IMDS token) when idle, achieving true cost parity with AWS/GCP. `mngr azure prepare` creates a least-privilege custom role (`mngr-self-deallocate`), and each VM gets a role assignment scoped to itself at create time. Degrades gracefully (with a clear warning) when the operator lacks role-assignment privilege.
- Added: New `azure-mgmt-authorization` dependency.

### Changed

- Changed: `deallocate_instance` / `start_instance` now honor their `timeout_seconds` and raise `VpsProvisioningError` on deadline expiry, matching the AWS/GCP clients.
- Changed: Azure's stopped-host offline discovery/resolution, deallocate/start lifecycle, and idle-watcher install now come from the shared `OfflineCapableVpsDockerProvider` base; Azure supplies only its specifics as hooks. No behavior change.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added: New `azure` provider backend (`mngr_azure`) — runs mngr agents in Docker containers on Azure VMs, a thin adapter over the shared VPS-Docker base like the `aws` / `gcp` / `vultr` providers. Works with no config after `az login` (credentials via `DefaultAzureCredential`, subscription auto-resolved from config / `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` / the active `az` subscription). Defaults to Debian 12 on `Standard_B2s`; Azure build args take the `--azure-` prefix (`--azure-region=`, `--azure-vm-size=`, and `--azure-spot` for opt-in Spot capacity).
- Added: `mngr azure prepare` / `mngr azure cleanup` — one-time network setup (the mngr-owned resource group + vnet + subnet + NSG) and its safe, idempotent inverse, which refuses while any managed VM still exists. `prepare` opens SSH to `allowed_ssh_cidrs`, which defaults to a warned-open `0.0.0.0/0` like AWS/GCP (set `[]` to opt out; auth is key-only).
- Added: Leak-free resource handling — destroying an agent removes its VM and all associated resources together, and failed creates clean up after themselves; misconfiguration surfaces actionable guidance (set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, run `az login`, or run `mngr azure prepare`) instead of a generic failure.
- Added: `auto_shutdown_seconds` schedules an OS shutdown, but note Azure has no native delete-after-duration (unlike AWS/GCP) and still bills for a stopped-but-not-deallocated VM.
