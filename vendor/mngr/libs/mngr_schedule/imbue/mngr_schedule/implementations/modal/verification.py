# Post-deploy verification for mngr schedule.
#
# After `modal deploy` uploads the cron function, the deploy-side verifier
# invokes it once via `modal run` to make sure it actually works. All of the
# real verification work -- creating the agent, inspecting its lifecycle
# state, destroying it if needed -- happens inside the Modal container (see
# cron_runner.py). That way whichever provider hosts the agent also owns the
# verification; the deploying machine does not have to peek across provider
# boundaries.
#
# This module just:
# 1. Builds the `modal run` command (including --verify-mode)
# 2. Streams stdout/stderr to the terminal so users see live progress
# 3. Parses the sentinel line the runner emits at the end ("__MNGR_SCHEDULE_VERIFY__ {...}")
# 4. Translates the structured result into success or ScheduleDeployError
#
# This module is excluded from unit test coverage because it requires real
# Modal and mngr infrastructure to execute (similar to cron_runner.py).
# It is exercised by the acceptance test in test_schedule_add.py.
