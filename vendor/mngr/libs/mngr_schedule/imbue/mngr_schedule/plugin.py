    If the container's mngr runs with no MNGR_ROOT_NAME, it defaults to "mngr"

    The miss forces get_or_create_profile_dir + get_or_create_user_id down the
    "fresh install" branch: mint a uuid4 profile + uuid4 user_id, which causes
    the Modal backend to create a new orphan `mngr-<uuid>` environment on every

    Propagating MNGR_ROOT_NAME keeps the container's lookup path aligned with
    where files were actually staged, so the deployer's full config (profile
    settings.toml, user_id, everything else) is used and the nested mngr calls
    land in the deployer's actual Modal env (derived prefix = `{root_name}-`)
