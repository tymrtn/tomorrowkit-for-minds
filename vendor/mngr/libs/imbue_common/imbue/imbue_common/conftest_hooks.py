"""Shared pytest conftest hooks for all projects in the monorepo.

Provides common test infrastructure:
- Global test locking (prevents parallel pytest processes from conflicting)
- Test suite timing limits (configurable via PYTEST_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS env var)
- xdist parallelism override (configurable via PYTEST_NUMPROCESSES env var)
- Output file redirection (slow tests report, coverage report)
- Shared pytest defaults (markers, filterwarnings, CLI args, coverage report config)
- Cached importlib.metadata.entry_points() for fast test startup on slow filesystems
- Resource mark enforcement (ensures tests are correctly marked for external tool usage)
- Test profiles: branch-name-based selective testing (see test_profiles.toml)

Environment variables:
- PYTEST_NUMPROCESSES: Override the number of xdist workers. Only effective when
  xdist is active but no explicit -n is on the command line (e.g. a developer
  running `uv run pytest` from a subpackage after setting up xdist through some
  other mechanism). The canonical local entry points are the `just test-*`
  recipes, which pass -n explicitly and therefore ignore this variable.
- PYTEST_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS: Override the maximum allowed test suite duration in seconds.
  Without this, defaults are chosen based on test type and environment (see
  _compute_max_duration for details).
- MNGR_TEST_PROFILE: Force a specific test profile (overrides branch detection).
  Set to "all" to disable profile filtering entirely.

Usage in each project's conftest.py:
    from imbue.imbue_common.conftest_hooks import register_conftest_hooks
    register_conftest_hooks(globals())

The register_conftest_hooks function uses a module-level guard to ensure hooks
are only registered once. This is critical because when running from the monorepo
root, both the root conftest.py AND per-project conftest.py files are discovered
by pytest. Without the guard, pytest_addoption would fail with duplicate option errors.
