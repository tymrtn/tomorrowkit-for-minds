## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.17] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added: Session adoption — `mngr create opencode --adopt <id-or-db-path>` makes a fresh opencode agent resume an existing conversation. The plugin resolves the id across the user-native opencode db and every live/preserved mngr agent's db, copies the source db (and `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars) into the new agent, rebinds the session's stored worktree path to the new agent's work dir, and writes a resume pointer. The flag is repeatable (subsequent sessions are merged into the single `opencode.db` so all appear in the switcher; the last one is resumed) and may be combined with `--from`. `--adopt-session` is accepted as an alias.
- Added: `--from <agent>` cloning of an opencode agent now resumes the source's conversation — the source's opencode store is transferred, the root session id is rebound to the clone's work dir, and a resume pointer is written. A source with no opencode store warns and starts fresh.
- Added: `OpenCodeAgent` declares the new capability mixins (`HasSessionPreservationMixin`, `HasUnattendedModeMixin`, `HasPermissionPolicyMixin`, `HasAutoInstallMixin`, `CliBackedAgentMixin`, `InteractiveAgentMixin`), so these capabilities are code-detectable in the agent capability matrix.
- Added: Auto-install of the `opencode` CLI — provisioning installs it (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`) when missing, gated by consent on local hosts and the remote-install config flag on remote hosts. New `check_installation` config field (default `True`) disables the check.

### Changed

- Changed: The opencode common-transcript emitter now emits `finish_reason` instead of `stop_reason` (aligning with the OpenTelemetry GenAI vocabulary) and an ordered `parts[]` array on assistant records preserving the text/tool-call interleaving.

## [v0.2.16] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added: opencode agents now preserve transcripts (raw + common) and the root session-id history on destroy, matching the claude plugin. New `preserve_on_destroy` config option (default `true`) — copied to `<local_host_dir>/preserved/<agent-name>--<agent-id>/`. Works for both online destroys and offline host destruction. opencode's native resumable session store (the SQLite `opencode.db` plus its `-wal`/`-shm` write-ahead-log sidecars and `storage/`) is preserved too, so the session can be resumed/adopted; the sibling `auth.json` (a symlink to shared credentials) and `log/` are excluded. WAL sidecars are copied alongside the db so recent (not-yet-checkpointed) turns are not lost.

## [v0.2.15] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added: `waiting_reason` field in `mngr list` for opencode agents (matching claude and codex): `PERMISSIONS` while blocked on an `ask` permission prompt, `END_OF_TURN` when idle. The in-process plugin tracks opencode's `permission.asked` / `permission.replied` events (concurrent prompts handled, accepting both the binary's and the SDK's event names). The reason is gated on the agent's `active` marker via a shared `classify_waiting_reason` in mngr core so claude / codex / opencode cannot drift.

## [v0.2.14] - 2026-06-15

## [v0.2.13] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added: Real OpenCode agent-type support at roughly `mngr_antigravity` parity (previously a bare config shell that ran the binary but reported WAITING forever, with no transcript, resume, or isolation). Each agent runs a headless `opencode serve` plus an `opencode attach` TUI client, driven by an in-process TypeScript plugin over the server's HTTP API: subagent-aware RUNNING/WAITING lifecycle, conversation resume across `mngr stop`/`start`, in-process raw and common transcripts (`emit_common_transcript`, default on), per-agent isolation (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`/`XDG_DATA_HOME`), and shared auth (the per-agent `auth.json` symlinks to the user's global login; `symlink_auth = false` for full isolation).
- Added: `opencode` agent-type config options (`config_overrides`, `sync_global_config`, `symlink_auth`, `auto_allow_permissions`, `emit_common_transcript`), plus a conformance test asserting opencode's emitted common-transcript records validate against the canonical envelope schema (`imbue.mngr.agents.common_transcript_records`), run on the shared agent release-lifecycle harness.
