"""Per-latchkey-directory encryption-key resolution.

Latchkey's credential store is encrypted with a key the operator
historically had to put in ``LATCHKEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` (or rely on a
system keychain we don't have on Linux dev boxes). For
minds-managed envs, that's both ergonomically painful (every fresh
shell or env switch needs the right export) and conceptually wrong:
each ``~/.minds-<env>/latchkey/`` has its own credential store, so
each should have its own key.

This module owns the convention: ``<latchkey_directory>/encryption_key``
holds a 32-byte URL-safe base64 key (chmod 0600). It's generated lazily
on first lookup; once written, it's read on every subsequent call.

Operator override: if ``LATCHKEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` is set in
``os.environ`` at lookup time, it wins over the per-env file. That
preserves the existing single-key-across-everything workflow for
operators who want it, while making "just run ``minds run``" work
out of the box for everyone else.

    Precedence:

    1. ``LATCHKEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` in :data:`os.environ` (operator

       not consulted or created.
    2. ``<latchkey_directory>/encryption_key`` if it exists. The
       file's permission bits are validated -- any group or other
       access bit set raises :class:`LatchkeyEncryptionKeyPermissionError`
       so an operator who relaxed the mode after a clipboard-paste or
       a stray ``chmod -R`` finds out loudly instead of silently
       leaking the key to other local users.
    3. Generate a fresh URL-safe base64 32-byte key, write to
       ``<latchkey_directory>/encryption_key`` with mode 0600, and
       return.

    Idempotent: re-calls return the same key as long as the file is
    intact. Cross-process safe via an atomic ``os.link``-based publish:
    the key is fully written and ``fsync``ed into a temp file first,
    then linked into the final path. The final path therefore only
    ever exists with complete contents, so a concurrent reader that
    sees it can never observe an empty or partially-written key. The
    link itself fails with ``FileExistsError`` if another process
    already published, in which case we read that version.
