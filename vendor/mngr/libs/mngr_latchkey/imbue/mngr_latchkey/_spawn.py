"""Private helpers: spawn detached ``latchkey`` / ``mngr latchkey forward`` subprocesses.

Why this file uses raw ``subprocess.Popen`` (triggering a narrow exclusion
from ``check_direct_subprocess``): we need the spawned processes to *outlive*
the caller. ``latchkey ensure-browser`` may download Chromium via
Playwright, which can take a while; detaching means we do not block
desktop-client shutdown on it and the next minds session will simply
re-check. ``mngr latchkey forward`` is the long-running supervisor that
owns the shared gateway and per-agent reverse tunnels; detaching means a
minds restart adopts the existing instance rather than tearing down and
re-establishing every tunnel.

Confining the remaining ``Popen`` calls to this tiny helper keeps the
ratchet exception obvious and well-scoped. The rest of the latchkey
package still goes through ``ConcurrencyGroup`` for any managed
subprocess work.

    """Start a detached ``mngr latchkey forward`` and return its PID.

    The child is placed in its own session (``setsid`` via
    ``start_new_session=True``) so it survives the caller's death. Its
    stdout/stderr are appended to ``log_path`` (the parent directory is
    created if needed). ``--latchkey-directory`` and ``--latchkey-binary``
    are passed explicitly so the subprocess uses the exact same latchkey
    state the caller knows about, regardless of any env / settings.toml
    state the inherited environment carries.

    ``cwd`` sets the spawned process's working directory. Callers that want
    the supervisor to behave like a laptop-side ``mngr`` invocation (the minds
    desktop client) pass ``$HOME`` so it does not resolve project config from a
    transient cwd -- e.g. a dev checkout whose ``.mngr/settings.toml`` would
    otherwise be loaded (and, under a pytest run, rejected by mngr's config
    guard). ``None`` inherits the caller's cwd.

    ``extra_env`` lets callers add (or override) environment variables
    for the spawned process; these flow into the ``latchkey gateway``
    subprocess via :func:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.core._build_gateway_env`
    (which inherits ``os.environ``) and from there into any gateway
    extension's ``process.env``. Used by the minds desktop client to
    publish the current ``LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_MINDS_API_URL`` to the
    bundled ``minds-api-proxy`` extension on every supervisor restart.

    The returned ``Popen`` object is intentionally allowed to go out of
    scope. Python's ``subprocess`` module parks finished children on an
    internal ``_active`` list for zombie reaping, but never kills a
    still-running child during garbage collection, so the forward
    supervisor keeps running until something explicitly terminates it.

    Two logs are produced. The process is pointed via ``--log-file`` at a
    co-located structured JSONL log (:func:`forward_events_log_path`), which
    carries nanosecond timestamps and is rotated mid-run by the standard mngr
    file sink -- this is the log to read when you need to observe timing.
    ``log_path`` is the raw stdout/stderr capture; its fd is handed straight to
    the child so it cannot be rotated mid-write. We pass ``--quiet`` so the
    child suppresses its loguru console handler (everything still goes to the
    structured log), which keeps this raw file from accumulating in steady
    state -- it then only ever captures rare startup-failure output (Click
    errors, pre-logging tracebacks) that never reaches the structured log.
