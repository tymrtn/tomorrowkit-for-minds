## [Unreleased]

## [v0.1.20] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Changed: Concurrency-group exception handling now raises a dedicated custom exception type instead of `ValueError`.

## [v0.1.19] - 2026-06-05

## [v0.1.18] - 2026-05-28

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Changed: Background processes started via `ConcurrencyGroup.run_process_in_background()` now default to `is_checked_by_group=True`, so non-zero exits surface as `ProcessError` at group teardown instead of being silently swallowed.
