"""Acceptance tests for Modal idle shutdown and snapshot creation.

These tests verify that the idle shutdown flow works correctly:
1. Host is created with activity_watcher.sh running
2. Initial snapshot is created during agent creation
3. When the host becomes idle, activity_watcher calls shutdown.sh
4. shutdown.sh calls the snapshot_and_shutdown Modal endpoint
5. The endpoint creates a snapshot and terminates the sandbox
6. The offline host record contains both snapshots

These tests require Modal credentials and network access. They are marked
with @pytest.mark.acceptance and are skipped by default. To run them:

    pytest -m acceptance --timeout=300 -k idle_shutdown
