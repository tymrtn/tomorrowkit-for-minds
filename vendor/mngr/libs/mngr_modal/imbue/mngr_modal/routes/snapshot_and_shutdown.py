"""
Modal function to snapshot and shut down a host.

This function is deployed as a Modal web endpoint and can be invoked to:
1. Snapshot a running Modal sandbox
2. Store the snapshot ID in the host's volume record
3. Terminate the sandbox

All code is self-contained in this file - no imports from the mngr codebase.

Required environment variable (must be set when deploying):
- MNGR_MODAL_APP_NAME: The Modal app name (e.g., "mngr-<user_id>-modal")

(note: do NOT remove this module docstring--this is a fully standalone script)
