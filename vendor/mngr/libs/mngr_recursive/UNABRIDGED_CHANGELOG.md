# Unabridged Changelog - mngr_recursive

Full, unedited changelog entries for the `mngr_recursive` project, consolidated nightly from individual files in `libs/mngr_recursive/changelog/`.

For a concise summary, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-06-12

Internal: routed the agent state-dir path construction through the shared `get_agent_state_dir_path` helper (now in `imbue.mngr.hosts.common`). No behavior change.

## 2026-06-08

Tests now isolate $HOME the same way as every other mngr plugin: the project
conftest calls `register_plugin_test_fixtures(globals())`, which brings in the
autouse `setup_test_mngr_env` fixture. Previously this plugin's tests did not
redirect $HOME, so running them on their own could read or write the real
`~/.mngr` / `~/.claude.json`. Internal test-infrastructure change only; no
user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-06-04

Fixed `mngr create` on remote hosts (e.g. Modal) failing during provisioning with `Error reading SSH protocol banner` / `Connection reset by peer` (github issue 1825). Deploy files are now uploaded with a single rsync transfer instead of one SFTP channel per file. The old per-file approach opened a fresh SFTP channel per file -- a full round-trip over the SSH tunnel (~0.7s/file over Modal) -- so a user's `~/.claude/plugins` tree (hundreds of files) would either exceed the upload timeout or reset the connection mid-transfer. The same set now transfers in seconds over one connection.

# Dropped redundant per-project ty/ruff ratchet tests

Removed this project's `test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors` from its
`test_ratchets.py`. ty resolves the uv workspace root and ruff (run from the repo
root) both scan across projects, so the per-project copies just re-ran the same
checks. The single repo-wide equivalents now live in `test_meta_ratchets.py`
(`test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors`).

No user-facing behavior change.

# ty 0.0.39 suppression syntax

- Converted the `RecursivePluginConfig.merge_with` override suppression from `# type: ignore[override]` to `# ty: ignore[invalid-method-override]`, as required by `ty` 0.0.39 (which no longer honors the bracketed mypy-style form).

- Tightened this project's `test_ratchets.py` violation counts to their exact current values (`--inline-snapshot=trim`).

No user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-05-26

- Pruned non-notable entries (test-only changes, internal refactors, and doc-only tweaks with no user-facing effect) from this project's CHANGELOG.md, per the new notable-only changelog policy.

Adopted the `PREVENT_BARE_TMUX_TARGETS` ratchet rule (added in `imbue_common`) via
`rc.check_bare_tmux_targets(_DIR, snapshot(0))` in this project's `test_ratchets.py`.
This ratchet prevents new occurrences of `tmux <subcmd> -t '<bare-name>'` -- targets
without a leading `=` exact-match prefix, which can silently route commands to a
sibling session whose name shares a prefix with the intended one. No production code
changes in this project; the adopting test starts at a baseline of zero violations.

## 2026-05-20

Project now participates in the per-project changelog layout: a `changelog/` subdirectory holds per-PR entry files, and `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` at the project root hold the consolidated history. See the full rationale in `dev/changelog/mngr-changelog-per-project.md`.
