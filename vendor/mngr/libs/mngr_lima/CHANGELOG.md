## [Unreleased]

## [v0.1.10] - 2026-06-18

## [v0.1.9] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Changed: `destroy_host` now raises a `CleanupFailedGroup` carrying the classified cleanup failures (instead of returning them, or swallowing errors as warnings) when a resource is left behind, and returns normally otherwise. A resource that was already gone is treated as benign; a resource that could not be destroyed is recorded as a `HOST_RESOURCE_REMAINS` failure (or `OTHER` for a bookkeeping write failure), so `mngr destroy`/`cleanup` can surface it and exit with a cause-specific code. See `specs/cleanup-error-aggregation.md`.

## [v0.1.8] - 2026-06-16

## [v0.1.7] - 2026-06-15

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added: `is_run_as_root` config field on the Lima provider — when enabled, mngr runs the agent in the VM as root (uid 0), so a coding agent can `apt install` and write anywhere with no `sudo`. mngr injects a root client key, enables key-based root login, and SSHes in as root. Requires the btrfs additional-disk layout (`is_host_data_volume_exposed=false`); the invalid combination with the 9p bind-mount layout is rejected at config construction.

### Changed

- Changed: Lima provider runs agents directly in the VM again (docker-in-VM mode removed — see Removed). Consistent dependency setup across providers is now achieved by having the project ship idempotent setup scripts that its `Dockerfile` runs (for docker/vps_docker/ovh) and that the Lima host runs directly after the project is synced in. btrfs-based backups continue to work because `host_dir` stays on a btrfs disk and the root agent can snapshot it directly.
- Changed: Offline hosts produced by this provider implement the new `HostFileReadInterface` (via the shared `make_readable_offline_host` helper / `OfflineHostWithVolume`), so a stopped host's files are readable through the same interface as an online host. Volume resolution is lazy on first read, so no per-host probe is added to host discovery.

### Removed

- Removed: Lima provider's `is_host_in_docker` mode entirely, along with all its config fields (`is_host_in_docker`, `container_ssh_port`, `default_image`, `builder`, `docker_install_timeout`, `container_ssh_connect_timeout`, `image_build_timeout_seconds`, `default_container_run_args`, `docker_runtime`, `install_gvisor_runtime`). Configs that still set these now fail to load; existing docker-mode Lima hosts (records with `is_host_in_docker=true`) are no longer startable — destroy and recreate them. The Lima provider no longer depends on `mngr_vps_docker`.

## [v0.1.5] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added: Opt-in `is_host_in_docker` mode on the Lima provider (`providers.lima.is_host_in_docker`, default `false`). When enabled, the agent runs inside a Docker container *in* the Lima VM (built from the project's Dockerfile, exactly like the docker/vps_docker providers) instead of directly in the VM; mngr treats the container as the host (ssh and all agent work happen inside it, Lima forwards the container's sshd out to the host's localhost). Forces `is_host_data_volume_exposed=false`; a per-host btrfs subvolume on the additional disk backs the container's `host_dir`, and the `mngr_vps_docker` snapshot helper is installed in the VM so the in-container agent can trigger consistent `btrfs subvolume snapshot` backups. `mngr stop` powers off the whole VM; `start` boots it and relaunches the container; `destroy` removes the VM and disk. Default (`is_host_in_docker=false`) behavior is unchanged.
- Added: `docker_runtime` and `install_gvisor_runtime` options on the Lima provider config (used in `is_host_in_docker` mode). `docker_runtime` (default unset) passes `--runtime=<value>` to the agent container's `docker run` inside the VM; `install_gvisor_runtime` (default `false`) installs and registers gVisor `runsc` with the in-VM Docker daemon via gVisor's official APT repository (idempotent). Installing is independent of enabling — set `docker_runtime = "runsc"` to run the agent container under gVisor.
- Added: `providers.lima.default_container_run_args` (default empty), extra arguments appended to the `docker run` that starts the agent container in `is_host_in_docker` mode — the only config path for injecting inner-container `docker run` flags on Lima. Pairs with `docker_runtime="runsc"` (e.g. `["--workdir=/", "--security-opt=no-new-privileges"]`).
- Added: `discover_hosts` now warns about orphaned Lima VMs — prefix-matched instances that no host record claims (leftovers from an interrupted create) are logged with the manual `limactl delete --force <name>` cleanup command, since mngr can neither manage nor garbage-collect a VM that has no record.

### Changed

- Changed: The Lima VM now installs a pinned Docker Engine version from Docker's official apt repo (the same version remote VPS providers use) instead of Debian's unpinned `docker.io` package, so workspace hosts run an identical, reproducible Docker regardless of provider.
- Changed: Default Lima VM image switched from Ubuntu 24.04 to a pinned Debian 12 "bookworm" genericcloud image (both `aarch64` and `x86_64`). Now that the agent typically runs inside a Docker container in the VM (`is_host_in_docker`), the VM only needs Docker + btrfs + sshd, and this mirrors the OVH provider's Debian 12 base. Override per-arch via `providers.lima.default_image_url_*`.
- Changed: Provisioning now formats and mounts the per-host btrfs data disk in-guest (idempotent; existing snapshot data survives) instead of relying on Lima's guestagent to auto-format it at boot. Minimal cloud images (the new Debian default) ship no `mkfs.btrfs`, which had left the disk unformatted and broke per-host subvolume creation. On later boots Lima's guestagent handles the mount.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Lima host creation now tears down half-built VMs on any failure, so the VM and its btrfs additional disk are always cleaned up (and a failed-host record written) when creation does not complete — including failure types (concurrency-group errors, timeouts, interrupts) that previously escaped cleanup and left an orphaned, untracked VM behind.

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-06-05

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added: Opt-in btrfs host-data volume mode for the Lima provider. New `is_host_data_volume_exposed: bool = True` field on `LimaProviderConfig` controls how `host_dir` is backed: `True` keeps today's 9p bind-mount layout; `False` attaches a Lima-managed btrfs additional disk (100GiB default) and symlinks `host_dir` to it, so `host_dir` is snapshottable as a single consistent btrfs filesystem. The layout is locked on the per-host record at create time so stop/start replay it. New `host_data_disk_size` config field (default `"100GiB"`).

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Changed: Dropped `ssh-keyscan` from the host-creation flow — each Lima VM now gets a pre-generated ed25519 host keypair injected via the Lima `provision[mode=system]` script, eliminating the TOFU and the `Broken pipe` race during VM bring-up. Per-host keys live under `<provider-dir>/keys/hosts/<host_id>/`; `merge_lima_yaml` extends (rather than replaces) `provision` and `mounts` so mngr's load-bearing entries are preserved.
- Changed: `mngr create --provider lima` help text now shows `--memory=N` / `--disk=N` (plain integers, no `GiB` suffix), matching what `limactl start` expects.
- Changed: Serial-log tailer switched from `tail --follow=name --retry` (GNU-only) to `tail -F` for macOS BSD-tail compatibility.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Lima provider now actually disables guest → host port forwarding — emits two ignore rules (`guestIP: 0.0.0.0` with `guestIPMustBeZero: true` and `guestIP: 127.0.0.1`), and `merge_lima_yaml` locks `portForwards` against user `--file` overrides.
