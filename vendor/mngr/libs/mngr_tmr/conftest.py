"""Project-level conftest for mngr-tmr.

When running tests from libs/mngr_tmr/, this conftest provides the common pytest hooks
that would otherwise come from the monorepo root conftest.py (which is not discovered
when pytest runs from a subdirectory).

When running from the monorepo root, the root conftest.py registers the hooks first,
and this file's register_conftest_hooks() call is a no-op (guarded by a module-level flag).
