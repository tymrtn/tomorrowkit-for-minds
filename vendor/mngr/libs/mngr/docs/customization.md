# Customization

`mngr` is designed to be highly customizable through configuration files, plugins, and custom agent types.

## Configuration Files

`mngr` loads configuration from multiple sources with the following precedence (lowest to highest):

1. User config: `~/.mngr/profiles/<profile_id>/settings.toml`
2. Project config: `.mngr/settings.toml` (at git root, context dir, or `MNGR_PROJECT_CONFIG_DIR`)
3. Local config: `.mngr/settings.local.toml` (at git root, context dir, or `MNGR_PROJECT_CONFIG_DIR`)
4. Environment variables: `MNGR_PREFIX`, `MNGR_HOST_DIR`, `MNGR_ROOT_NAME`
5. CLI arguments (highest precedence)

### Default Subcommands

You can configure which subcommand runs when a command group is invoked with no recognized subcommand. By default, both `mngr` and `mngr snapshot` with no subcommand show help.

To restore the old behavior where `mngr my-task` is equivalent to `mngr create my-task`, set the default subcommand explicitly:

```toml
# .mngr/settings.toml

# Running bare `mngr` defaults to `mngr create` (opt-in)
[commands.mngr]
default_subcommand = "create"

# Running bare `mngr` defaults to `mngr list` instead
[commands.mngr]
default_subcommand = "list"
```

**Disabling a configured default:**

Set `default_subcommand` to an empty string to disable defaulting entirely. When disabled (or absent), running the group with no subcommand shows help, and unrecognized arguments produce an error instead of being forwarded.

```toml
[commands.mngr]
default_subcommand = ""   # explicitly disable (same as the built-in default)
```

**Notes:**

- If `default_subcommand` is absent from config, both `mngr` and `mngr snapshot` show help (no defaulting).
- The `default_subcommand` key can coexist with parameter defaults in the same `[commands.<name>]` section.
- Config file precedence applies as usual: local config overrides project config, which overrides user config.

### Default Command Parameters

You can override default values for CLI command parameters in your config files. This is particularly useful for setting project-specific or user-specific defaults.

**How it works:**

- Config files can define default values for any CLI parameter using `[commands.<command_name>]` sections
- These defaults only apply when the user doesn't explicitly specify a value
- User-specified values (via CLI or environment) always take precedence

**Example:**

```toml
# .mngr/settings.toml

# Override defaults for the 'create' command
[commands.create]
connect = false               # Don't auto-connect after creation
ensure_clean = false          # Allow dirty working trees
name_style = "scifi"          # Use sci-fi style names by default
```

With this config:

- `mngr create` → Doesn't connect, allows dirty trees
- `mngr create --connect` → Connects (user override wins)

**Parameter names:**

- Use the parameter name as it appears in the CLI (after click's conversion)
- Boolean flags: use `connect = true` or `connect = false` (not `--connect`/`--no-connect`)

**Scope:**

Command defaults are particularly useful for:

- Project-specific workflows (e.g., always use docker for this project)
- Personal preferences (e.g., prefer fantasy names over english)
- Team conventions (e.g., standard provider or host settings)

**Note:** Config defaults are applied only to parameters that weren't explicitly specified on the command line.

### Create Templates

Templates provide named presets of create command arguments that can be quickly applied using `--template <name>` (or `-t <name>`). This is particularly useful when working with different providers where paths, environment variables, or other settings need to be different.

**How it works:**

- Templates are defined in config files under `[create_templates.<template_name>]` sections
- When using `--template <name>` (or `-t <name>`), all template options are applied as defaults
- Multiple templates can be specified and are applied in order, stacking their values (e.g., `-t modal -t codex`)
- When templates overlap on the same parameter, later templates override earlier ones
- CLI arguments still take precedence over all template values
- Templates from multiple config files with the same name are merged (later configs override earlier ones)

**Example:**

```toml
# .mngr/settings.toml

# Template for running agents in Modal
[create_templates.modal]
provider = "modal"
target_path = "/root/workspace"
idle_timeout = 3600

# Template for running agents in Docker
[create_templates.docker]
provider = "docker"
target_path = "/workspace"

# Template with extra commands for development
[create_templates.dev]
provider = "modal"
extra_window = ["server=npm run dev", "logs=tail -f /var/log/app.log"]
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Use the modal template
mngr create my-agent --template modal

# Use the docker template (short form)
mngr create my-agent -t docker

# Template with CLI override
mngr create my-agent --template modal --idle-timeout 7200

# Stack multiple templates (host config + agent config)
mngr create my-agent -t modal -t dev
```

**Why use templates?**

Templates are useful when:

- Composing "what" to run (agent args) with "where" to run it (host config) without creating a template for every combination
- Working with multiple providers that have different path conventions
- Setting up common configurations that you use frequently
- Sharing consistent settings across a team without repeating CLI arguments
- Creating environment-specific presets (development, staging, production)

Templates differ from command defaults in that they must be explicitly selected with `--template`, while command defaults are always applied automatically.

### Work Directory Extra Paths

When creating agents with `--worktree` or `--copy-source`, certain files outside of git (e.g., local config, virtual environments, build caches) are not included by default. The `work_dir_extra_paths` setting lets you declare which additional paths should be available in new work directories and how they should be transferred.

```toml
# .mngr/settings.toml

[work_dir_extra_paths]
".mngr/settings.local.toml" = "SHARE"
".venv" = "COPY"
".test_output" = "COPY"
```

**Modes:**

- `"SHARE"`: On the same host, creates a symlink from the work directory to the source path (shared source of truth). When copying to a different host, falls back to copying via rsync since symlinks across hosts are not possible.
- `"COPY"`: Always copies the path via rsync, creating an independent copy in each work directory.

**When to use each mode:**

- Use `"SHARE"` for config files that are the same regardless of branch, like `.mngr/settings.local.toml`.
- Use `"COPY"` for paths that depend on branch state (like `.venv` or `node_modules`, which reflect each branch's dependencies) or that each work directory should own independently (like test output).

**Behavior details:**

- Paths are relative to the project root. Absolute paths and paths that escape the project root are rejected.
- If a source path does not exist, it is skipped with a warning.
- Symlinks are idempotent: if the correct symlink already exists, it is left in place.
- If a non-symlink file or directory already exists at the target location when `"SHARE"` mode would create a symlink, an error is raised.
- Config merging follows the same per-key override behavior as `pre_command_scripts`: project config overrides user config for each path independently.
