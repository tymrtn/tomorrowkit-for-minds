# Security Model

`mngr` runs code in isolated hosts. The security of that isolation depends on your choice of [provider](./concepts/providers.md).

## Trust Model

**Plugins** are fully trusted. They execute with your privileges and can access your files, credentials, and network. Only install plugins from sources you trust.

**Providers** are trusted to enforce isolation between hosts and to honestly report host state. They will technically have access to files written to disk and in-memory state, and thus are assumed to be highly trusted.

**Hosts** are containers within which is can be *possible* to run untrusted code. The security of that isolation depends on the provider. For example, a Docker-based provider relies on Docker's isolation mechanisms, which are generally strong but not infallible. A cloud-based VM provider relies on the cloud provider's hypervisor security. Local hosts have no isolation and should only run fully trusted code. The user is responsible for deciding which information to grant to a host / the agents on a host.

Note that the idle detection script runs inside the host, so untrusted code could potentially interfere with it. To prevent this, use a provider that enforces host lifetime limits externally (e.g., Modal's sandbox timeout), which is more robust than any client-side enforcement.

**Agents** on the same host are assumed to all have full access to all information and capabilities on the host. If you want isolation, use a separate host and restrict what information is shared with that host.
