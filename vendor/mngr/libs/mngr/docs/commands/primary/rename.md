# mngr rename

**Synopsis:**

```text
mngr [rename|mv] <CURRENT> <NEW-NAME> [--dry-run] [--start/--no-start] [--host] [-l KEY=VALUE ...]
```

Rename an agent or host [experimental].

Updates the agent's name in its data.json and renames the tmux session
if the agent is currently running. Git branch names are not renamed.

If the host is offline, the rename is applied to the provider's
persisted agent data without starting the host; tmux and env-file
updates are skipped (data.json remains the source of truth for the
agent's name). Pass --start to force the host online first so tmux
and the env file are updated alongside data.json.

If a previous rename was interrupted (e.g., the tmux session was renamed
but data.json was not updated), re-running the command will attempt
to complete it.

Alias: mv

**Usage:**

```text
mngr rename [OPTIONS] CURRENT NEW-NAME
```
## Arguments

- `CURRENT`: Current name or ID of the agent to rename
- `NEW-NAME`: New name for the agent

**Options:**

## Behavior

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | Show what would be renamed without actually renaming | `False` |
| `--start`, `--no-start` | boolean | If the host is offline, start it before renaming so the tmux session and on-host env file are updated alongside data.json. Default: do not start; rename only edits the provider's persisted agent data. | `False` |
| `--host` | boolean | Rename a host instead of an agent [future] | `False` |

## Labels

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `-l`, `--label` | text | Apply a KEY=VALUE label in the same atomic write as the rename (repeatable). Avoids the race where an external observer sees the renamed agent before separate `mngr label` calls have applied labels. | None |

## Common

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `--format` | text | Output format (human, json, jsonl, FORMAT): Output format for results. When a template is provided, fields use standard python templating like 'name: {agent.name}' See below for available fields. | `human` |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | boolean | Suppress all console output | `False` |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | integer range | Increase verbosity (default: BUILD); -v for DEBUG, -vv for TRACE | `0` |
| `--log-file` | path | Path to log file (overrides default ~/.mngr/events/logs/<timestamp>-<pid>.json) | None |
| `--log-commands`, `--no-log-commands` | boolean | Log commands that were executed | None |
| `--headless` | boolean | Disable all interactive behavior (prompts, TUI, editor). Also settable via MNGR_HEADLESS env var or 'headless' config key. | `False` |
| `--safe` | boolean | Always query all providers during discovery (disable event-stream optimization). Use this when interfacing with mngr from multiple machines. | `False` |
| `--plugin`, `--enable-plugin` | text | Enable a plugin [repeatable] | None |
| `--disable-plugin` | text | Disable a plugin [repeatable] | None |
| `-S`, `--setting` | text | Override a config setting for this invocation (KEY=VALUE, dot-separated paths; append __extend to the leaf key to extend list/dict/set fields) [repeatable] | None |
| `-h`, `--help` | boolean | Show this message and exit. | `False` |
