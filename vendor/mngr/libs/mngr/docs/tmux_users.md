## Nested tmux

Mngr runs your agents in tmux sessions.
If you already use tmux to run `mngr` itself,
by default, `mngr` won't be able to drop you into the agents' tmux sessions,
because `tmux` refuses to run inside `tmux` by default.

There are two approaches to solve this:

- If you prefer to keep the agents' tmux sessions outside the session where you run `mngr`,
  you can use an alternative `connect-command` to the `create` and `start` subcommands,
  which can, for example, open a new terminal tab and connect to the agent session from there.

  In particular, if you use iTerms2, there's a builtin plugin to do that for you -
  run `mngr plugin list` to see it.

- You can tell `mngr` to allow nested tmux -
  it should have printed a command to do so.

When using nested tmux,
you'll need some configuration to make the keybindings work for both the "outside" and "inside" sessions.
There are several approaches:

- In tmux's default binding,
  pressing `Ctrl-B` twice sends `Ctrl-B` to the program running inside tmux.

  This means you can use all your prefixed keybindings simply by pressing an extra `Ctrl-B` every time.

- You can also configure an alternative keybinding for tmux sessions created by `mngr`,
  by editing `~/.mngr/tmux.conf`.

- A slightly more advanced approach is to have a key that swaps the outer tmux's key table,
  effectively making it switch between which layer of tmux you want to operate on.
  For example, to use F12 for this purpose, put the following in your `~/.tmux.conf`:

  ```
  bind -T root F12  \
    set prefix None \;\
    set key-table off \;\
    set status-style "fg=colour245,bg=colour238" \;\
    refresh-client -S

  bind -T off F12 \
    set -u prefix \;\
    set -u key-table \;\
    set -u status-style \;\
    refresh-client -S
  ```

You can find other approaches by searching for "nested tmux" or "tmux in tmux".

## Customizing mngr's tmux sessions

A `[tmux]` section in your settings (`~/.mngr/settings.toml`, or a project's `.mngr/settings.toml`) controls how `mngr` creates and attaches to agent sessions:

```toml
[tmux]
# Extra tmux client flags inserted before `attach` when you connect to an agent,
# i.e. `tmux <attach_args> attach ...`. The motivating case is iTerm2 control mode:
attach_args = ["-CC"]

# An extra tmux config file sourced into every mngr session. Unlike the
# auto-generated ~/.mngr/tmux.conf (which mngr overwrites), this file is yours
# to edit and is never regenerated -- the stable place for session-specific config.
additional_config_path = "~/.mngr/tmux.user.conf"

# Name of the window the agent runs in (default "agent"). mngr targets this
# window by name, so it works no matter what `base-index` you set.
primary_window_name = "agent"
```

### iTerm2 control mode (`-CC`)

Setting `attach_args = ["-CC"]` makes `mngr connect` (and `mngr create`/`start` when they attach) run `tmux -CC attach`, so iTerm2 renders your agent's tmux windows as native iTerm2 tabs/windows. This applies to both local and remote (SSH) agents. `-CC` is a tmux *client* flag, which is why it goes before the `attach` subcommand; other client flags such as `-u` (force UTF-8) or `-2` (force 256-color) work here too.

### Extra session config (`additional_config_path`)

tmux loads your `~/.tmux.conf` itself when its server starts, so `mngr` does not re-source it (re-sourcing non-idempotent config on every agent start could corrupt your setup). The generated `~/.mngr/tmux.conf` holds only `mngr`'s own settings and is marked "do not edit" (it is rewritten each time an agent starts). To add tmux config that applies only to `mngr` sessions (custom status styling, keybindings, etc.), point `additional_config_path` at a file and put your config there -- `mngr` sources it (if it exists) into every session and never touches it. For remote agents the path is resolved on the agent's host, so the file must exist there.

### tmux `base-index`

If your `~/.tmux.conf` sets `set -g base-index 1` (or any non-default value), `mngr` still works: it names the agent's window and targets it by name rather than by the `:0` index, so there is nothing extra to configure.

## Isolating mngr's tmux sessions

By default, `mngr` creates tmux sessions on your default tmux server. This means `mngr`'s sessions will show up alongside your personal sessions in `tmux ls`, and could interfere with your own tmux workflow.

To keep `mngr`'s tmux sessions isolated from your own, set `TMUX_TMPDIR` to give `mngr` its own tmux server:

```bash
TMUX_TMPDIR="/tmp/mngr-tmux" mngr create my-agent
```

Your normal `tmux ls` will no longer show `mngr`'s sessions, and you won't run into nested tmux issues.

Note: the directory must already exist or tmux will silently connect to the normal server instead.
