# Agents

An agent is simply a process running in window 0 of a properly-named tmux session (e.g. `mngr-<agent-id>`)

Each agent runs inside a working directory (`work_dir`) on a [host](./hosts.md).

Each agent has a name, a unique identifier (`agent-id`), and is a particular ["agent type"](agent_types.md).

Each agent can have **labels** -- key-value string pairs that provide metadata about the agent. The most common label is `project`, which is automatically set based on the git remote origin or folder name. Labels are used for filtering and organizing agents (e.g., `mngr list --project mngr` or `mngr list --label env=prod`).

Labels are distinct from **host labels**: labels are agent-level metadata, while host labels are host-level metadata. Use `--label KEY=VALUE` when creating an agent to attach custom labels, and `--host-label KEY=VALUE` for host-level labels.

Nothing stops you from creating additional invocations of agent programs inside the tmux session (e.g. launching multiple Claude Code's), but only the main agent process for a given tmux session is considered by `mngr` for the purposes of detecting the agent's state.

## Passing Arguments

Arguments after `--` go directly to the agent command:

```bash
mngr create my-agent claude -- --model opus
```

To see what arguments an agent accepts, use `mngr create my-agent <type> -- --help`.

## Overriding Defaults

You can override plugin defaults:

```bash
mngr create my-agent claude --idle-timeout 1h      # Override timeout
```

## Running a Custom Command

Use `--type command` with the command after `--` to run a literal command instead of using an agent type:

```bash
mngr create my-agent --type command -- sleep 1000          # Run a simple command
mngr create my-agent --type command -- ./my-script.sh      # Run a custom script
```

See [`mngr create`](../commands/primary/create.md) for all available options.

## Capabilities

Any unix process can be an agent, which means that the only strict requirement is that the program run in a properly-named tmux session (e.g. "mngr-<agent_name>").

Many (most) programs that you want to run as agents will support additional "capabilities" that `mngr` can leverage to provide extra functionality, for example:

- Agents can put their "status" in a special file that `mngr` reads to show in `mngr list` (for example, "Thinking...", "Waiting for input", etc.)
- Agents can self-report when they are active (which enables automatic shutdown of "idle" hosts), see [idle detection](./idle_detection.md) for details
- Agents can expose URLs for web interfaces (and the default plugins automatically create a secure web terminal via ttyd for CLI agents [future])
- Agents can be sent messages via `mngr message` (for example, to provide user input or commands). This applies to all unix process (since we're just writing to stdin).
- Agents can be created recursively (and, with the `recursive_mngr` plugin, understand their "parent" agents and create remote child agents as well).
- Agents can define custom properties for any additional functionality (e.g., providing a stream of events, exposing a REST API, etc.)

## Hierarchy

Agents can create other agents via recursive invocations of `mngr`.

```bash
# Inside an agent, create a child agent
mngr create sub-task-agent claude
```

By default, the `mngr` binary only exposes the "local" provider, which means that these child agents run on the same host as the parent.

If you want to allow agents to create remote/untrusted child agents, see the [recursive mngr plugin](../../future_specs/plugins/recursive_mngr.md) [future] for security considerations and more details.

## Lifecycle

Assuming the agent's [host](./hosts.md) is in the "running" state, an agent can be in one of the following states:

- **stopped**: the agent folder exists (but there is no tmux session)
- **running**: tmux session exists and the expected process exists in pane 0
- **waiting**: the agent is waiting (e.g., for user input or an external event)
- **replaced**: tmux session exists and a different process in pane 0
- **done**: the tmux session exists and there is no process under the shell for that pane

If the host's state is not "running", then the agent inherits it state from the host (ex: paused, crashed, etc, see [host lifecycle](./hosts.md#Lifecycle) for more details)

## Properties

See [agent spec](../../future_specs/agent.md) for the properties of agents and their storage locations.

You can also run [`mngr list --help`](../commands/primary/list.md#available-fields) for the full list.

## Interface

See [`imbue/mngr/interfaces/agent.py`](../../imbue/mngr/interfaces/agent.py) for the agent data structures.
