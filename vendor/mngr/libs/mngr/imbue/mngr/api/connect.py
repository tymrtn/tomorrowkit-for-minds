    """Build a shell command that sends SIGWINCH to every pane's child processes.

    After a tmux client attaches, the agent process needs a SIGWINCH to re-query
    its terminal size (TIOCGWINSZ) and redraw at the client's dimensions. We send
    the signal directly rather than via ``tmux resize-window`` because
    resize-window has a documented side effect of switching the window's
    ``window-size`` option to ``manual`` -- which pins the window at its current
    size and stops it tracking later client resizes, so the user sees a field of
    padding dots once their terminal grows past the pinned size. With
    ``window-size`` left at tmux's default (``latest``), the window already
    resizes to match the client on attach and on every subsequent terminal
    resize; this script's only job is to nudge the in-pane process to redraw.

    Uses pgrep -P to find child processes of each pane. This avoids any
    dependency on matching the agent's process name, which is unreliable
    (on macOS, Claude's process title shows as its version number rather
    than "claude").

    The session component is rendered via :class:`TmuxSessionTarget`;
