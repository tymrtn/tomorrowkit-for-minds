##############################################################################
# CREATING AGENTS
#   One of the most common things you'll want to do with mngr is create agents. There are *tons* of options,
#   so basically any workflow you want should be supported.
##############################################################################

## BASIC CREATION

# running mngr create is strictly better than running claude!
# (if you use the alias `mngr c`, it's no more letters to type :-D)
# running this command launches your default agent immediately *in a new worktree*
mngr create
# the defaults are the following: agent=your configured default (stored under `[commands.create] type`
# in user settings; `scripts/install.sh` interactively prompts you to pick one as part of
# `mngr extras -i`, and you can re-run `mngr extras config` later to pick or change it),
# provider=local, project=current dir

# you can run the agent in-place (directly in your source directory) without any transfer:
mngr create my-task --transfer=none
# mngr defaults to creating a new worktree for each agent because the whole point of mngr is to let you run multiple agents in parallel.
# without creating a new worktree for each, they will make conflicting changes with one another.

# when creating agents to accomplish tasks, it's recommended that you give them a name to make it easier to manage them:
mngr create my-task
# that command gives the agent a name of "my-task". If you don't specify a name, mngr will generate a random one for you.

# you can name the agent type explicitly as a positional argument, or use the short form for the
# command itself (`mngr c` is an alias for `mngr create`). For example, when claude is your default
# agent type, `mngr c my-task` is equivalent to `mngr create my-task claude`:
mngr create my-task claude
mngr c my-task

# for the rest of this doc, we'll use the explicit form (specifying "create") just to be extra clear,
# but you might want to use the short form in your day-to-day work for speed and convenience.
# you can (and should) create aliases and templates as well (see TEMPLATES, ALIASES, AND SHORTCUTS below)

# you can also specify a different agent (ex: codex)
mngr create my-task codex

# you can specify the arguments to the *agent* (ie, send args to the agent rather than mngr)
# by using `--` to separate the agent arguments from the mngr arguments:
mngr create my-task -- --model opus
# that command passes the "--model opus" flag to your default agent (e.g. claude, when claude
# is configured as the default)

# you can also launch your default agent remotely in Modal:
mngr create my-task --provider modal
# see more details below in "CREATING AGENTS REMOTELY" for relevant options

# to run an arbitrary shell command, use the built-in `command` agent type
# and put the command (and its args) after `--`:
mngr create my-task --type command -- python my_script.py
# remember that the arguments to the "agent" (or command) come after the `--` separator

# this enables some pretty interesting use cases, like running servers or other programs (besides AI agents)
# this makes debugging easy--you can snapshot when a task is complete, then later connect to that exact machine state:
mngr create my-task --type command --idle-mode run --idle-timeout 60 -- python my_long_running_script.py extra-args
# see "RUNNING NON-AGENT PROCESSES" below for more details

# alternatively, you can simply add extra tmux windows that run alongside your agent:
mngr create my-task -w server="npm run dev" -w logs="tail -f app.log"
# that command automatically starts two tmux windows named "server" and "logs" that run those commands (in addition to the main window that runs the agent)

## SENDING MESSAGES ON LAUNCH

# you can send an initial message (so you don't have to wait around, eg, while a Modal container starts)
mngr create my-task --provider modal --no-connect --message "Speed up one of my tests and make a PR on github"
# here we disable the default --connect behavior (because presumably you just wanted to launch that in the background and continue on your way)
# and then we also pass in an explicit message for the agent to start working on immediately
# the message can also be specified as the contents of a file (by using --message-file instead of --message)

# you can also edit the message *while the agent is starting up*, which is very handy for making it "feel" instant:
mngr create my-task --provider modal --edit-message

## SPECIFYING DATA FOR THE AGENT

# by default, the agent uses the data from its current git repo (if any) or folder, but you can specify a different source:
mngr create my-task --from /path/to/some/other/project

# similarly, by default the agent is tagged with a "project" label that matches the name of the current git repo (or folder), but you can specify a different project:
mngr create my-task --project my-project

# mngr doesn't require git at all--if there's no git repo, it will just use the files from the folder as the source data
mkdir -p /tmp/my_random_folder
echo "print('hello world')" > /tmp/my_random_folder/script.py
mngr create my-task --from /tmp/my_random_folder --type command -- python script.py

# however, if you do use git, mngr makes that convenient
# by default, it creates a new git branch for each agent (so that their changes don't conflict with each other):
mngr create my-task
git branch | grep mngr/my-task

# --branch controls branch creation. The format is "BASE:NEW", where BASE is the branch to start from and NEW is the branch to create.
# omitting BASE (i.e. starting with ":") uses the current branch. The * in NEW is replaced by the agent name.
# the default is ":mngr/*", which creates a new branch named mngr/{agent_name} off the current branch.
# you can change the pattern:
mngr create my-task --branch ":feature/*"
git branch | grep feature/my-task

# you can also specify a different base branch (instead of the current branch):
mngr create my-task --branch "main:mngr/*"

# or set the new branch name explicitly:
mngr create my-task --branch ":feature/my-task"

# you can create a full copy (an independent git mirror) instead of a worktree:
mngr create my-task --transfer=git-mirror
# (a plain rsync copy is used by default if you're not in a git repo)

# you can disable new branch creation entirely by omitting the :NEW part:
mngr create my-task --branch main
# this checks out the existing branch in the worktree (or copy) without creating a new one

# you can create a full git "clone" instead of a worktree or copy: this transfers the repo via git, giving the agent its own independent copy with a separate working directory and git history (this is also the default when the source and target are on different hosts):
mngr create my-task --transfer=git-mirror

# you can clone from an existing agent's work directory:
mngr create my-task --from other-agent
# (--source is an alias for --from; the format supports agent@host.provider:path)

# you can use rsync to transfer extra data as well, beyond just the git data:
mngr create my-task --provider modal --rsync --rsync-args "--exclude=node_modules"

## CREATING AGENTS REMOTELY

# one of the coolest features of mngr is the ability to create agents on remote hosts just as easily as you can create them locally:
mngr create my-task --provider modal -- --dangerously-skip-permissions --append-system-prompt "Don't ask me any questions!"
# that command passes the "--dangerously-skip-permissions" flag to claude because it's safe to do so:
# agents running remotely are running in a sandboxed environment where they can't really mess anything up on their local machine (or if they do, it doesn't matter)
# because it's running remotely, you might also want something like that system prompt (to tell it not to get blocked on you)

# running agents remotely is really cool because you can create an unlimited number of them, but it comes with some downsides
# one of the main downsides is cost--remote hosts aren't free, and if you forget about them, they can rack up a big bill.
# mngr makes it really easy to deal with this by automatically shutting down hosts when their agents are idle:
mngr create my-task --provider modal --idle-timeout 60
# that command shuts down the Modal host (and agent) after 1 minute of inactivity.

# You can customize what "inactivity" means by using the --idle-mode flag:
mngr create my-task --provider modal --idle-mode "ssh"
# that command will only consider agents as "idle" when you are not connected to them
# see the idle_detection.md file for more details on idle detection and timeouts

# you can specify which existing host to run on using the address syntax (eg, if you have multiple Modal hosts or SSH servers):
mngr create my-task@my-dev-box

# generally though, you'll want to construct a new Modal host for each agent.
# build arguments let you customize that new remote host (eg, GPU type, memory, base Docker image for Modal):
mngr create my-task --provider modal -b cpu=4 -b memory=16 -b image=python:3.12
# see "mngr create --help" for all provider-specific build args
# some other useful Modal build args: --region, --timeout, --offline (blocks network), --secret, --cidr-allowlist, --context-dir

# the most important build args for Modal are probably "--file" and "--context-dir",
# which let you specify a custom Dockerfile and build context directory (respectively) for building the host environment.
# This is how you can get custom dependencies, files, and setup steps on your Modal hosts. For example:
mngr create my-task --provider modal -b file=./Dockerfile.agent -b context-dir=./agent-context
# that command builds a Modal host using the Dockerfile at ./Dockerfile.agent and the build context at ./agent-context
# (which is where the Dockerfile can COPY files from, and also where build args are evaluated from)

# you can name the host using the address syntax:
mngr create my-task@my-modal-box.modal --new-host
# (--host-name-style and --name-style control auto-generated name styles for hosts and agents respectively)

# you can mount persistent Modal volumes in order to share data between hosts, or have it be available even when they are offline (or after they are destroyed):
mngr create my-task --provider modal -b volume=my-data:/data

# you can use an existing snapshot instead of building a new host from scratch:
mngr create my-task --provider modal --snapshot snap-123abc

# some providers (like docker), take "start" args as well as build args:
mngr create my-task --provider docker -s "--gpus all"
# these args are passed to "docker run", whereas the build args are passed to "docker build".

# you can specify the target path where the agent's work directory will be mounted:
mngr create my-task@.modal:/workspace

# you can upload files and run custom commands during host provisioning:
mngr create my-task --provider modal --upload-file ~/.ssh/config:/root/.ssh/config --extra-provision-command "pip install foo"
# (provision commands run as the host's default user; prefix with sudo to run as root if it is not)

# by default, agents are started when a host is booted. This can be disabled:
mngr create my-task --provider modal --no-start-on-boot
# but it only makes sense to do this if you are running multiple agents on the same host
# that's because hosts are automatically stopped when they have no more running agents, so you have to have at least one.

## CONTROLLING THE AGENT ENVIRONMENT

# you can set environment variables for the agent:
mngr create my-task --env DEBUG=true
# (--env-file loads from a file, --pass-env forwards a variable from your current shell)

# it is *strongly encouraged* to either use --env-file or --pass-env, especially for any sensitive environment variables (like API keys) rather than --env, because that way they won't end up in your shell history or in your config files by accident. For example:
export API_KEY=abc123
mngr create my-task --pass-env API_KEY
# that command passes the API_KEY environment variable from your current shell into the agent's environment, without you having to specify the value on the command line.

# you can also set host-level environment variables (separate from agent env vars):
mngr create my-task --provider modal --pass-host-env MY_VAR
# --host-env-file and --pass-host-env work the same as their agent counterparts, and again, you should generally prefer those forms (but if you really need to you can use --host-env to specify host env vars directly)

## TEMPLATES, ALIASES, AND SHORTCUTS

# you can use templates to quickly apply a set of preconfigured options:
echo '[create_templates.my_modal_template]' >> .mngr/settings.local.toml
echo 'provider = "modal"' >> .mngr/settings.local.toml
echo 'build_arg = ["cpu=4"]' >> .mngr/settings.local.toml
mngr create my-task --template my_modal_template
# templates are defined in your config (see the CONFIGURATION section for more) and can be stacked: --template modal --template codex
# templates take exactly the same parameters as the create command
# -t is short for --template. Many commands have a short form (see the "--help")

# you can enable or disable specific plugins:
mngr create my-task --plugin my-plugin --disable-plugin other-plugin

# you should probably use aliases for making little shortcuts for yourself, because many of the commands can get a bit long:
echo "alias mc='mngr create --transfer=none'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
# or use a more sophisticated tool, like Espanso

## TIPS AND TRICKS

# by default, mngr aborts the create command if the working tree has uncommitted changes. You can avoid this by doing:
mngr create my-task --no-ensure-clean
# this is particularly useful when, for example, you are in the middle of a merge conflict and you just want the agent to finish it off
# it should probably be avoided in general, because it makes it more difficult to merge work later.

# another handy trick is to make the create command "idempotent" so that you don't need to worry about remembering whether you created an agent yet or not:
mngr create sisyphus --reuse --provider modal
# if that agent already exists, it will be reused (and started) instead of creating a new one. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.

# you can control connection retries and timeouts via settings.toml:
# [retry]
# connect_retry_times = 5
# connect_retry_delay = "10s"
# (--reconnect / --no-reconnect controls auto-reconnect on disconnect)

# you can use a custom connect command instead of the default (eg, useful for, say, connecting in a new iterm window instead of the current one)
mngr create my-task --connect-command "my_script.sh"

# you can add labels to organize your agents and tags for host metadata:
mngr create my-task --label team=backend --host-label env=staging

## CREATING AND USING AGENTS PROGRAMMATICALLY

# mngr is very much meant to be used for scripting and automation, so nothing requires interactivity.
# if you want to be sure that interactivity is disabled, you can use the --headless flag:
mngr create my-task --headless

# or you can set that option in your config so that it always applies:
mngr config set headless true

# or you can set it as an environment variable:
export MNGR_HEADLESS=true

# *all* mngr options work like that. For example, if you want to always run agents in Modal by default, you can set that in your config:
mngr config set commands.create.provider modal
# for more on configuration, see the CONFIGURATION section below

# you can control output format for scripting:
mngr create my-task --no-connect --format json
# (--quiet suppresses all output)

# you can send a message when starting the agent (great for scripting):
mngr create my-task --no-connect --message "Do the thing"

## LEARNING MORE

# tons more arguments for anything you could want! As always, you can learn more via --help
mngr create --help

# or see the other commands--list, destroy, message, connect, git, clone, and more!  These other commands are covered in their own sections below.
mngr --help

##############################################################################
# LISTING AGENTS
#   After you've created a bunch of agents, you might lose track of them! So "mngr list" makes it easy to see all of your agents,
#   as well as any important information about them (ex: where they're running, when they were last active, etc.)
##############################################################################

# list all agents
mngr list

# short form
mngr ls

# show only running agents
mngr list --running

# show only stopped agents (not running, still exists and can be restarted)
mngr list --stopped

# show only archived agents (stopped, cannot necessarily be restarted, but data can be inspected)
mngr list --archived

# show only active agents (anything not archived/destroyed/crashed/failed)
mngr list --active

# you can make any of those filters the default for "mngr list" by setting it in your config.
# for example, to hide agents from dead/destroyed hosts by default:
mngr config set commands.list.active true
# to opt out for a single call, override the env var: MNGR__COMMANDS__LIST__ACTIVE=false mngr list

# note: --active only excludes hosts in CRASHED/FAILED/DESTROYED state and archived agents,
# *not* STOPPED or DONE agents. if you want to also hide STOPPED and DONE agents from the default,
# use an exclude filter instead:
#   [commands.list]
#   exclude = ['state == "STOPPED"', 'state == "DONE"']

# show only agents running locally
mngr list --local

# show only agents running remotely
mngr list --remote

# filter by provider
mngr list --provider modal

# filter by project
mngr list --project my-project

# filter by agent label
mngr list --label TEAM=backend

# filter by host label
mngr list --host-label ENV=staging

# choose which fields to display and sort order
mngr list --fields "name,state,host.provider,create_time" --sort "create_time desc"
# see mngr list --help for a complete list of fields you can reference

# limit the number of results
mngr list --limit 10

# watch mode: refresh the list every 5 seconds
watch -n5 mngr list

# output all objects as one big JSON array when complete  (useful for scripting)
mngr list --format json

# output each entry as a JSON object (useful for scripting)
mngr list --format jsonl

# continually stream discovery events as JSONL (useful for piping to jq to turn this data into an event stream)
# will get new events as new hosts are created/destroyed, come online and offline, etc.
# see the `DiscoveryEvent` type for a complete list of the event types that will be returned in this stream
mngr observe --discovery-only

# you can pass the ids of agents and/or hosts to only list details for specific ids:
mngr list --format "{id}" | head -n 2 | mngr list --stdin

##############################################################################
# CONNECTING TO AGENTS
#   If you've disconnected from an agent (or created one with --no-connect),
#   you can reconnect to it at any time.
##############################################################################

# connect to a running agent by name
mngr connect my-task

# short form
mngr conn my-task

# sometimes names can be ambiguous (e.g. if you made two agents with the same name on different hosts), so you can always
# be really specific by using the agent id instead of the name:
mngr connect agent-fa29307a16734899aa77b0f0563c8c99

# or you can use the explicit host and agent:
mngr conn my-task@my-host

# or if you're really unlucky and have multiple *hosts* with the same name (across different providers),
# you can use the explicit host, agent and provider:
mngr conn my-task@my-host.modal

# the default behavior is to start the agent if it's stopped (you can be explicit about that too):
mngr connect my-task --start

# or you can disable auto-starting (fails if agent is stopped)
mngr connect my-task --no-start

##############################################################################
# SENDING MESSAGES TO AGENTS
#   You can send messages to running agents without connecting to them.
#   This is useful for giving agents new instructions while they work.
##############################################################################

# send a message to a specific agent
mngr message my-task -m "Please also add unit tests for the new function"

# short form
mngr msg my-task -m "Check the CI results and fix any failures"

# send the same message to multiple agents by name
mngr msg agent-1 agent-2 agent-3 -m "Wrap up and commit your changes"

# send a message to every agent by piping their ids from `mngr list`
mngr list --ids | mngr msg - -m "Stop what you are doing and commit your current progress"

# send a message to agents matching a filter
mngr list --include 'host.provider == "modal"' --ids | mngr msg - -m "Almost out of budget, please finish up"

# control error handling when messaging multiple agents
# your choices are:
#   "continue", which means try all agents once, or
#   "abort", which means stop if any agent fails to receive the message
# note that "abort" is kind of dangerous--you could easily have agents left in a strange state
# thus the default is "continue"
mngr list --ids | mngr msg - -m "Status update please" --on-error continue

##############################################################################
# EXECUTING COMMANDS ON AGENTS
#   Run shell commands on an agent's host without connecting interactively.
#   Useful for scripting, checking status, or running one-off operations.
##############################################################################

# run a command on a specific agent's host
mngr exec my-task "ls -la /workspace"
# note that the command must be quoted--it's the last argument passed to "mngr exec"
# the quoting is required because e.g. this may be sent over SSH

# short form
mngr x my-task "git status"

# run a command on all agents
mngr exec -a "whoami"

# run a command as a specific user as you normally would on that host (ex: sudo -u other-user)
mngr exec my-task "sudo -u other-user apt-get update"

# run a command in a specific working directory
mngr exec my-task --cwd /tmp "pwd"
# by default, commands are run in the agent's work_dir

# set a timeout (in seconds) for the command
mngr exec my-task --timeout 30 "python long_script.py"

# by default, start the agent's host if it's stopped, run the command, then leave it running
# but you can be explicit about that behavior:
mngr exec my-task --start "cat /etc/os-release"

# and you can disable auto-starting as well (fails if agent is stopped):
mngr exec my-task --no-start "cat /etc/os-release"

# control error handling when running on multiple agents
mngr list --ids | mngr exec - --on-error continue "git log --oneline -5"
# the choices for --on-error are the same as for messaging: "continue" (try all agents) and "abort" (stop if any agent fails)

# FIXME: sure, these might be experimental, but they could at least use some tests! I think they work in theory...
##############################################################################
# PUSHING FILES TO AGENTS
#   Push local files or git commits to a running agent. This is how you
#   sync your local changes to an agent's workspace.
##############################################################################

# Use "mngr rsync <local> <agent>" to push files. See "mngr rsync --help".
# Use "mngr git push <agent>" to push git commits. See "mngr git push --help".

##############################################################################
# PULLING FILES FROM AGENTS
#   Pull files or git commits from an agent back to your local machine.
#   This is how you retrieve an agent's work.
##############################################################################

# Use "mngr rsync <agent> <local>" to pull files. See "mngr rsync --help".
# Use "mngr git pull <agent>" to pull git commits. See "mngr git pull --help".

##############################################################################
# PAIRING WITH AGENTS
#   Continuously sync files between your local machine and an agent in
#   real time. Great for working alongside an agent on the same codebase.
##############################################################################

# "pair" is an experimental command. See "mngr pair --help" for current usage.

##############################################################################
# STARTING AND STOPPING AGENTS
#   Stopped agents can be restarted, and running agents can be stopped to
#   free resources. Stopping can optionally create a snapshot for later.
##############################################################################


# start a stopped agent. Is idempotent, so is safe to call even if already running.
mngr start my-task

# start a stopped agent and immediately connect to it
mngr start my-task --connect

# start multiple agents at once
mngr start agent-1 agent-2 agent-3

# start all stopped agents by simply passing their ids from "mngr list" and reading the ids from stdin (that's what the "-" means)
mngr list --ids | mngr start -

# dry-run to see what would happen without actually starting anything
mngr list --ids | mngr start - --dry-run

# stop a running agent
mngr stop my-task

# stop and archive the agent (marks it archived so it can be filtered out of listings; its state is preserved).
mngr stop my-task --archive

# you can also archive an agent via the "archive" command, which is basically just a shortcut for "stop --archive"
mngr archive my-task

# stop all running agents
mngr list --ids | mngr stop -

# archive all stopped agents (handy for cleaning up "mngr list" after a batch of finished work).
mngr list --stopped --ids | mngr archive -

# dry-run to see what would be stopped
mngr list --ids | mngr stop - --dry-run

# stop has a special variant for finding an agent by its tmux session name:
mngr stop --session my-session-name
# this is used primarily to implement the hotkey for exiting from tmux (ex: ctrl-t)

##############################################################################
# DESTROYING AGENTS
#   When you're done with an agent, destroy it to clean up all of its
#   resources (host, snapshots, volumes, etc.).
##############################################################################

# destroy a specific agent
mngr destroy my-task

# short form
mngr rm my-task

# destroy without confirmation prompt
mngr destroy my-task --force

# destroy and also remove the git branch that was created for the agent
# this is not the default because it can be annoying to lose the changes, so we default to the safe option
mngr destroy my-task --force --remove-created-branch

# destroy multiple agents at once
mngr destroy agent-1 agent-2 agent-3 --force

# destroy all agents (be careful!)
mngr list --ids | mngr destroy - --force

# to preview what would be destroyed without doing it, run without --force and answer "no" at the prompt
mngr destroy my-task

# destroy and run garbage collection afterward (this is the default)
mngr destroy my-task --force --gc

# by default, gc (garbage collection) runs after destroying any agent
# you can disable this if you want:
mngr destroy --no-gc
# however, note that it is generally a good idea to ensure that "mngr gc" is run periodically,
# otherwise resources (ex: worktrees, hosts, containers, volumes, etc) will accumulate over time

# destroy has a special variant for finding an agent by its tmux session name:
mngr destroy --session my-session-name
# this is used primarily to implement the hotkey for exiting from tmux (ex: ctrl-q)

##############################################################################
# CLONING AND MIGRATING AGENTS
#   Clone an agent to create a copy of it (on the same or different host),
#   or migrate an agent to move it to a different host entirely.
##############################################################################

# "clone" is an experimental command. See "mngr clone --help" for current usage.
# "migrate" is an experimental command. See "mngr migrate --help" for current usage.

##############################################################################
# MANAGING SNAPSHOTS
#   Snapshots capture the filesystem state of a host. You can create, list,
#   and destroy them, and use them to restore or fork agents.
##############################################################################


# create a snapshot of an agent's host
mngr snapshot create my-task

# short form
mngr snap create my-task

# create a snapshot with a descriptive name
mngr snapshot create my-task --name "before-refactor"

# snapshot all agents' hosts
mngr list --ids | mngr snapshot create -

# list snapshots for all running agents
mngr list --ids | mngr snapshot list -

# list snapshots for a specific agent's host
mngr snapshot list my-task

# limit the number of snapshots shown
mngr snapshot list my-task --limit 5

# destroy a specific snapshot
mngr snapshot destroy my-task --snapshot snap-123abc

# destroy all snapshots for an agent's host
mngr snapshot destroy my-task --all-snapshots --force

# dry-run to see what would be destroyed
mngr snapshot destroy my-task --all-snapshots --dry-run

# TODO: I think it'd be worth going through the provision ones sooner rather than later...
##############################################################################
# PROVISIONING AGENTS
#   Re-run provisioning steps on an existing agent, such as installing
#   packages, uploading files, or running setup commands.
##############################################################################

# "provision" is an experimental command. See "mngr provision --help" for current usage.

##############################################################################
# RENAMING AGENTS
#   Rename an agent to something more descriptive, or to avoid name
#   collisions.
##############################################################################

# "rename" is an experimental command. See "mngr rename --help" for current usage.

##############################################################################
# MANAGING AGENT LIMITS
#   Configure idle timeouts, activity tracking, and other runtime limits
#   for agents and hosts.
##############################################################################

# "limit" is an experimental command. See "mngr limit --help" for current usage.

##############################################################################
# CLEANING UP RESOURCES
#   Bulk-destroy or stop agents based on filters like age, idle time, or
#   provider. Also garbage-collect unused resources like orphaned snapshots
#   and volumes.
##############################################################################


# garbage collect all unused resources
mngr gc

# if you want to see what would be cleaned before actually running garbage collection
mngr gc --dry-run

# garbage collect for a specific provider only (repeatable if you want multiple providers)
mngr gc --provider modal

# if you wanted, you could disable automatic garbage collection on destroy by setting the appropriate setting:
mngr config set commands.destroy.gc false
# then make sure you constantly run gc in the background (this runs it once every 60 seconds)
watch -n60 mngr gc
# this would have the effect of making your calls to "mngr destroy" somewhat faster, at the cost of needing to have this background process running

# VIEWING EVENTS AND LOGS
#   View event stream and log files for agents and hosts. Useful for debugging and
#   monitoring what your agents are up to.
##############################################################################

# view all events for an agent
mngr event my-task
# all events are json objects that are guaranteed to have at least the following fields: "event_id", "timestamp", "source" and "type"
# events are printed as JSONL (one JSON object per line), so you can easily pipe them to jq for filtering and formatting, or to other tools for monitoring and alerting

# follow events in real time (like tail -f). Extremely useful for scripting.
mngr event my-task --follow

# restrict the event stream to a specific type of event (source)
# in this case we're looking at the "claude/common_transcript" events for a claude agent,
# which shows the conversation messages in and out of the agent in a unified format
mngr event my-task --follow claude/common_transcript

# show only the last 20 events
mngr event my-task --tail 20

# show only the first 10 events
mngr event my-task --head 10

# include only events matching a CEL expression
mngr event my-task --include 'type == "user_message"'

# view the transcript of an agent's conversation
mngr transcript my-task

# view only assistant messages
mngr transcript my-task --role assistant

# view the last 5 messages
mngr transcript my-task --tail 5

# quickly peek at an agent's most recent message without connecting (handy for sanity-checking many agents)
mngr transcript my-task --tail 1

# output transcript as JSONL for programmatic use

##############################################################################
# PROJECTS
#   Agents are automatically associated with a project (the git repo you
#   run mngr from). Use projects to organize agents and filter your list.
##############################################################################


# agents inherit the project from the directory where you run mngr create.
# the project is typically the name of the git repo.
# list agents for the current project only
mngr list --project my-project

# create an agent explicitly tagged with a different project
mngr create my-task --project other-project

# filter agents by project using CEL expressions
mngr list --include 'project == "my-project"'

# the literal "." is expanded to the current project (derived from your git worktree
# root's remote origin, falling back to its source-repo dir name (for worktrees) or
# folder name, so it stays correct from any subdirectory), so this lists agents for
# the project you're currently in:
mngr list --project .
# this also works for "mngr kanpan --project ."

# to make this the default, set it in the project-scoped config (.mngr/settings.toml).
# project-scoped config only applies when run from inside that project, so you get a
# per-project default for free:
#   [commands.list]
#   project = ["."]

# see which projects have agents by looking at the project field
mngr list --fields "name,project,state"

##############################################################################

##############################################################################


# by default, mngr automatically creates a new branch for each agent (default: mngr/{agent_name})
# you can specify the base branch, or disable branch creation if you want to work on an existing branch instead
# all of that was covered in detail in the CREATING AGENTS section above

# check what branch an agent is on (it may have shifted if the agent checked out a new branch)
mngr exec my-task "git branch --show-current"

# you can see the branch mngr created for each agent as part of the details in "mngr list" as well (field name: "initial_branch")
mngr list --fields "name,state,initial_branch"

# check if the agent has uncommitted changes
mngr exec my-task "git status --short"

# see the agent's recent commits
mngr exec my-task "git log --oneline -5"

# ask the agent to commit its work
mngr msg my-task -m "Please commit all your changes with a descriptive message"

# or forcibly commit all of it yourself
mngr exec my-task 'git add . && git commit -m "WIP: save agent progress"'

# check all agents' git status at once
mngr list --ids | mngr exec - "git status --short"

# merge the agent's work like normal if the agent is local:
git merge mngr/my-task

# and if remote, force the agent to push, then fetch and merge:
mngr exec my-task "git push origin mngr/my-task"
git fetch --all && git merge mngr/my-task
# in general, you should probably just tell your agents to automatically push / create PRs when it makes sense

# TODO: give an example of how to use a stop hook to automatically push for the agent

# TODO: add some more example with mngr git pull for how to merge work back in

# when destroying, clean up the branch that was originally created when the agent was created

##############################################################################
# LABELS AND FILTERING
#   Tag agents with labels and either use CEL filter expressions to target
#   specific agents, or just use jq. Filter agents for destroy, cleanup, and other commands
#   by piping in the names or ids from a call to mngr list
##############################################################################


# create agents with labels for organization
mngr create my-task --label team=backend --label priority=high

# list agents filtered by label using CEL expressions
mngr list --include 'labels.priority == "high"'

# combine multiple filters (AND logic for --include, all must match)
mngr list --include 'labels.team == "backend"' --include 'state == "RUNNING"'

# exclude agents matching a filter
mngr list --exclude 'labels.team == "frontend"'

# combine multiple exclusion filters (OR logic for --exclude, any can match)
mngr list --exclude 'labels.team == "frontend"' --exclude 'labels.team == "devops"'

# you can also just do combined filters directly in the CEL expression:
mngr list --include 'labels.team == "backend" && state == "RUNNING"'

# use filters with other commands: message only backend agents by passing "-" to have the list of matching agents piped in via stdin
mngr list --include 'labels.team == "backend"' --ids | mngr message - -m "Please run the backend test suite"

# use filters with exec: check disk usage on remote agents only
mngr list --include 'host.provider == "modal"' --ids | mngr exec - "df -h /workspace"

# use filters with destroy: clean up all stopped agents for a team
mngr list --include 'labels.team == "backend"' --include 'state == "STOPPED"' --ids | mngr destroy - --force --dry-run

# you can also just list agents by filtering using jq:
mngr list --format json | jq '.agents[] | select(.labels.priority == "high")'

# or even stream the filters with jq by using jsonl:
mngr list --format jsonl | jq --unbuffered 'select(.labels.priority == "high")'


##############################################################################
# CREATE TEMPLATES
#   Define reusable presets that bundle common options (provider, build
#   args, environment, etc.) into a single template name.
##############################################################################

# templates are defined in your config (user, project, or local scope).
# here's how to set one up using the config command:
mngr config edit --scope project
# in the editor, add something like:
#   [create_templates.modal-big]
#   provider = "modal"
#   build_arg = ["cpu=4", "memory=16"]
#   idle_timeout = "120"
#   agent_args = ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
# then use the template when creating agents:
mngr create my-task --template modal-big

# short form
mngr create my-task -t modal-big

# stack multiple templates (later templates override earlier ones)
mngr create my-task --template modal-big --template with-tests

##############################################################################
# CUSTOM AGENT TYPES
#   Define your own agent types in config, or use the built-in `command` type
#   to run any shell command. Wrap existing tools with custom defaults.
##############################################################################

# mngr supports multiple agent types out of the box (claude, codex, etc.)
# you can also run any shell command as an "agent" using the built-in `command` type:
mngr create my-server --type command -- python -m http.server 8080

# run a custom script as an agent
mngr create my-task --type command -- my-tool --some-flag

# agent types are provided by plugins -- see MANAGING PLUGINS above
# to see which agent types are available:
mngr plugin list --active

# you can specify the agent type as the second positional argument to create:
mngr create my-task codex

# or by specifying it explicitly
mngr create my-task --type codex

# you can also create your own custom agent types by defining them in a config:
# here's how to set one up using the config command:
mngr config edit --scope project
# in the editor, add something like:
#   [agent_types.yolo]
#   parent_type = "claude"
#   cli_args = "--dangerously-skip-permissions"
# then you can create agents of that type:
mngr create my-task yolo
# you'll have to look at the agent config class for each agent type to know what config options are supported

# FIXME: make those plugins actually show those config options

##############################################################################
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#   Pass environment variables to agents during creation, control mngr
#   behavior via env vars, and understand the variables mngr sets for you.
##############################################################################

##############################################################################
# SETTING-ONLY OPTIONS
#   Some behavior can only be changed from the settings (not from the CLI)
#   These options are typically less commonly used or more advanced
##############################################################################

# MNGR_HOST_DIR / default_host_dir: by default mngr stores its state (agent metadata, events,
# discovery cache, etc.) under ~/.mngr. if you'd rather scope state per-project, point it at a
# project-local directory. note that this completely isolates state per-project (you won't see
# agents from other projects), so it's most useful for sandboxes or clean per-project setups.
# the cleanest way to do this is with direnv -- add a .envrc to your project:
#   export MNGR_HOST_DIR="$PWD/.mngr-state"
# and then "direnv allow". you can also set it as an absolute path in config:
#   default_host_dir = "/abs/path/to/project/.mngr-state"

# work_dir_extra_paths: include extra files (outside of git) in each new agent work directory.
# useful for things like .env files, .venv, build caches, or local config that aren't tracked in git.
# add this to .mngr/settings.toml (or settings.local.toml):
#   [work_dir_extra_paths]
#   ".env" = "COPY"
#   ".mngr/settings.local.toml" = "SHARE"
#   ".venv" = "COPY"
# "COPY" makes an independent copy via rsync (good for branch-dependent paths like .venv).
# "SHARE" symlinks to the source on the same host (good for shared config like settings.local.toml,
# so that editing the one file at the project root immediately applies to every local agent).
# "SHARE" automatically falls back to a copy when transferring to a different host.

##############################################################################
# OUTPUT FORMATS AND MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT
#   Switch between human-readable, JSON, and JSONL output. Use --format
#   with templates, pipe output to jq, and build tooling on top of mngr.
##############################################################################

# default output is human-readable
mngr ls

# use custom format templates to customize human-readable output for yourself
mngr list --format '{name} ({state})'

# TODO: some of these commands are kind of duplicated...  what should we do about that?
#  perhaps a single test could point to multiple commands?

# JSON output (full array, good for programmatic use)
mngr list --format json

# JSONL output (one object per line, good for streaming/piping)
mngr list --format jsonl

# stream discovery events as JSONL (hosts and agents discovered/destroyed)
mngr observe --discovery-only

# JSON and JSONL works with most commands
mngr list --format json && mngr plugin list --format jsonl

# combine json with jq for powerful filtering and transformation

# mngr conn = mngr connect, mngr msg = mngr message, mngr exec = mngr x

# use --reuse to make create idempotent. This is handy, esp with remote scripts, so that you can detach, then hit up and enter
# and not have to worry about remembering whether it is started, etc (because it will attach by default)
mngr create --reuse --provider modal my-task

# use watch with list to keep a live dashboard in a terminal
watch -n 5 mngr list

# use exec to quickly inspect an agent's environment

# or use exec to see something across a bunch of hosts by combining with mngr list:
mngr list --include 'host.provider == "modal"' --ids | mngr exec - 'echo $MNGR_AGENT_ID && env | sort'

# if you want to get really fancy, you can use xargs to run in parallel across hosts:
