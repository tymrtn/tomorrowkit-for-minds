Corrected the package version back to 0.1.0 (it had been bumped to 0.1.1, but that version was never actually released).

## 2026-06-16

New package `imbue-mngr-pi-coding-usage`: cost/usage tracking for pi agents in `mngr usage`. pi reports per-message cost client-side, so it's REPORTED (not estimated) and aggregated session-incrementally. Because pi loads a single explicit extension, the per-message writer lives in mngr_pi_coding's lifecycle extension; this package owns the reader (an `aggregate_usage_source` hookimpl claiming the `pi-coding` source) and provisions a `pi_emit_usage` gate marker so the extension only emits usage events when this package (their reader) is installed.
