## [Unreleased]

## [v0.1.14] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added: Session adoption — `mngr create pi --adopt <id-or-path>` makes a fresh pi-coding agent resume an existing conversation. Each resolved session is copied into the new agent's store and its embedded working directory is rebound to the new agent's work_dir (so pi never stalls at its "working directory does not exist" dialog). Resolved across the user-native store, every live mngr agent, and every preserved (destroyed) agent. The flag is repeatable and may be combined with `--from`. `--adopt-session` is accepted as an alias.
- Added: `--from <agent>` cloning of a pi-coding agent now resumes the source agent's pi conversation — the source's native session store is transferred, its most-recent session is rebound to the clone's work_dir, and the resume pointer is written. A source with no resumable pi session warns and starts fresh.
- Added: `PiCodingAgent` declares the new capability mixins (`HasSessionPreservationMixin`, `HasUnattendedModeMixin`, `HasAutoInstallMixin`, `CliBackedAgentMixin`, `InteractiveAgentMixin`) and exposes a `waiting_reason` field generator (single-valued END_OF_TURN since pi has no tool-approval gate), so these capabilities are code-detectable in the agent capability matrix. pi gains an `auto_allow_permissions` config field pinned to True (setting it False is rejected, since pi cannot enforce a deny).
- Added: Auto-install of the `pi` CLI is now routed through the shared `ensure_cli_installed` helper (it now also prompts in interactive mode rather than only honoring `--yes`).

### Changed

- Changed: When `auto_dismiss_dialogs` is set (also implied by `mngr create --yes`), mngr now launches pi with its native `--approve` flag, so pi auto-trusts the agent's project folder for the run and its "Trust project folder?" dialog never blocks the first message.
- Changed: The pi-coding common-transcript emitter now emits `finish_reason` instead of `stop_reason` (aligning with the OpenTelemetry GenAI vocabulary) and an ordered `parts[]` array on assistant records preserving the text/tool-call interleaving.

## [v0.1.13] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added: pi-coding agents now preserve transcripts (raw + common), the recorded session-file pointer, and pi's native resumable session store (`plugin/pi_coding/sessions`) on destroy — so the conversation content itself now survives (previously only the dangling pointer was kept once the store was deleted). New `preserve_on_destroy` config option (default `true`) — copied to `<local_host_dir>/preserved/<agent-name>--<agent-id>/`. Works for both online destroys and offline host destruction. The credential `auth.json` is a path-separate sibling and is excluded.
- Added: pi lifecycle extension now writes per-message usage events (cost + tokens) for `mngr usage`, gated on a `pi_emit_usage` marker that the new `imbue-mngr-pi-coding-usage` package provisions. Inert unless the gate marker is present, so behavior is unchanged for agents without the usage plugin installed.

## [v0.1.12] - 2026-06-16

## [v0.1.11] - 2026-06-15

## [v0.1.10] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added: `pi` alias for the `pi-coding` agent type (`mngr create my-agent pi` is equivalent to `mngr create my-agent pi-coding`).
- Added: Real pi-coding lifecycle parity, driven by a single mngr-owned pi extension loaded with `pi -e` (pi has no shell hooks): `mngr list` RUNNING/WAITING (correct even when an agent spawns a nested `pi`), `mngr transcript` with raw + common transcripts (`emit_common_transcript` / `emit_raw_transcript`, default on), `mngr stop`/`start` session resume (`resume_session`, default on), a real readiness sentinel instead of banner-scraping, remote npm auto-install (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`), reliable message delivery via a watched per-agent inbox file (`pi.sendUserMessage`) instead of tmux keystrokes (TUI still viewable via `mngr connect`), pi 0.79+ "Trust project folder?" handling by pre-seeding `trust.json` (gated like claude/antigravity; silent under `--yes` / `auto_dismiss_dialogs`, else prompts), and syncing the `agents/` resource dir from `~/.pi/agent/`.
- Added: Conformance test asserting pi's emitted common-transcript records validate against the canonical envelope schema (`imbue.mngr.agents.common_transcript_records`), run on the shared agent release-lifecycle harness.

## [v0.1.9] - 2026-06-08

## [v0.1.8] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Fixed: Remote provisioning of pi resource directories (skills/prompts/extensions/themes) now transfers with a single rsync (`host.copy_local_directory`) instead of uploading each file individually over SSH. The per-file approach opened an SFTP channel per file and did not scale to large resource sets (the same failure mode as github issue 1825).

## [v0.1.7] - 2026-06-01

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Changed: Plugin uses the structured `TmuxWindowTarget` type for tmux pane targeting; `_send_enter_and_validate` now takes `tmux_target: TmuxWindowTarget` instead of a bare string.
