    can race their ``auth_refresh_session`` calls; the second to arrive

    -- after which every subsequent refresh for that user fails until
    they sign in again. ``fcntl.flock`` is advisory but every refresh
    path goes through this helper, so the advisory contract is binding
    in practice.
