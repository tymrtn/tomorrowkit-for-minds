# imbue-mngr-tutor

Interactive tutorial for learning mngr commands.

A plugin for [mngr](https://github.com/imbue-ai/mngr) that adds the `mngr tutor` command. Launch with `mngr tutor` in a separate terminal from your main working terminal.

## How it works

The tutor presents a menu of lessons, each with ordered steps. For each step:

1. Read the instructions in the tutor terminal
2. Run the suggested commands in your other terminal
3. The tutor automatically detects when the step is complete and advances

Completion is detected by monitoring agent state, filesystem changes, and tmux sessions -- no manual confirmation needed.

## Lessons

### Basic Local Agent

Learn to create, use, and manage your first agent locally:

- Create an agent with `mngr create`
- Send commands via `mngr message`
- Stop and restart the agent
- Destroy the agent when finished

A lesson on remote agents on Modal (`--in modal`) is in progress and not yet available.

## Tips

- Run the tutor in a separate terminal window, not a tmux pane, to avoid confusion with the agent's tmux session
- You can skip `mngr start` and just run `mngr connect` directly -- it starts the agent first if needed
- Press Ctrl-T or Ctrl-Q within an agent's tmux session as shortcuts for `mngr stop` and `mngr destroy`
