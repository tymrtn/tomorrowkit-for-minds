# Unabridged Changelog - resource_guards

Full, unedited changelog entries consolidated nightly from individual files in `libs/resource_guards/changelog/`.

For a concise summary, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-06-04

Adopted the new repo-wide `per-file host uploads inside loops` ratchet check (flags write_file/write_text_file/put_file calls inside loops, which should use a single rsync via host.copy_directory instead). No production code change in this project.

# Dropped redundant per-project ty/ruff ratchet tests

Removed this project's `test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors` from its
`test_ratchets.py`. ty resolves the uv workspace root and ruff (run from the repo
root) both scan across projects, so the per-project copies just re-ran the same
checks. The single repo-wide equivalents now live in `test_meta_ratchets.py`
(`test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors`).

No user-facing behavior change.

# ty 0.0.39 type fixes

- `fixture_uses_resources`'s `TypeVar` is now bound to a small `_NamedCallable` protocol (a callable that also carries `__name__`), so reading `func.__name__` in the misconfiguration error type-checks under `ty` 0.0.39. The decorator is only ever applied to fixture functions, which satisfy the protocol.
- The pytest hookwrapper generators (`_pytest_fixture_setup`, `_pytest_runtest_makereport`, and their plugin-class wrappers) now annotate their generator send type as `pluggy.Result[...]`, so `outcome.get_result()` / `outcome.excinfo` resolve instead of being treated as attributes of `None`.

No user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-05-26

- Pruned non-notable entries (test-only changes, internal refactors, and doc-only tweaks with no user-facing effect) from this project's CHANGELOG.md, per the new notable-only changelog policy.

Adopted the `PREVENT_BARE_TMUX_TARGETS` ratchet rule (added in `imbue_common`) via
`rc.check_bare_tmux_targets(_DIR, snapshot(0))` in this project's `test_ratchets.py`.
This ratchet prevents new occurrences of `tmux <subcmd> -t '<bare-name>'` -- targets
without a leading `=` exact-match prefix, which can silently route commands to a
sibling session whose name shares a prefix with the intended one. No production code
changes in this project; the adopting test starts at a baseline of zero violations.

## 2026-05-21

Fix the intro in `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` so it references the correct entries directory. The path was `changelog/<project>/` (which never existed); the actual layout is `<project_dir>/changelog/`.

## 2026-05-20

Project now participates in the per-project changelog layout: a `changelog/` subdirectory holds per-PR entry files, and `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` at the project root hold the consolidated history. See the full rationale in `dev/changelog/mngr-changelog-per-project.md`.

Add `@fixture_uses_resources` to `imbue.resource_guards` for declaring resource use at the fixture level. Module/session-scoped fixtures that opt in run their setup and teardown under their own guard scope, so resource calls inside the fixture are authorized against the fixture's declaration rather than the consuming test's marks. Untouched fixtures keep existing behavior.

Adjust the mark semantics around `@fixture_uses_resources`:

- `@pytest.mark.<resource>` on a test is now satisfied by either direct resource invocation in the test body OR by a `@fixture_uses_resources(<resource>)` fixture in the test's closure.
- The mark is now **required** on every consumer of a tagged fixture, even consumers that don't directly invoke the resource. This makes `pytest -m <resource>` the canonical selector for every test that transitively needs the resource, with no silent escape hatch.
- The block check (calls without the mark) is unchanged.
