"""Resolves ``<agent-id>.localhost`` requests to a backend ``ProxyTarget``.

Holds three pieces of state, all updated externally:

- The configured forwarding strategy: either ``ForwardServiceStrategy`` (look
  up a named service URL per agent) or ``ForwardPortStrategy`` (forward to a
  fixed remote port on the agent's host).
- ``services_by_agent``: per-agent service-name → URL, populated from the
  ``mngr event`` stream's ``services`` source.
- ``ssh_by_agent``: per-agent SSH info, populated from the ``mngr observe``
  stream's ``HOST_SSH_INFO`` events; absent for local agents.

The single public method ``resolve(agent_id)`` returns ``None`` when the
agent is unknown, the requested service URL is not yet discovered, or the
agent has no SSH info but the strategy requires one.
